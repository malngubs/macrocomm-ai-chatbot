1 INTRODUCTION

1.1. The Remuneration Policy details the principles and framework around which
Macrocomm’s remuneration strategy has been developed and serves as a
guideline against which all remuneration related decisions will be taken. It
ensures that matters relating to determination and payment of
remuneration are dealt with in a fair, consistent, and transparent manner.

2 OBJECTIVE AND PRINCIPLES OF THE REMUNERATION
STRATEGY

2.1 Organizational growth and success cannot be achieved without employee
competence. Consequently, the employee's obligation to competently
complete various activities related to the Company's business objectives lies
at the heart of the employment relationship.

2.2 To achieve competence, employees must apply their knowledge, skills, and
personal attributes (abilities) to perform their job activities to the required
performance standards. It is therefore clear that employee ability is a
prerequisite to employee performance.

2.3. The primary objective of the Company's remuneration strategy is to ensure
that the Company can attract, develop, and retain employees with the
intellectual and behavioural abilities required to complete various activities
related to the Company's objectives. To do so the Company will pay
remuneration rates in line with the rates called for in the labour market.

2.4 The Company further recognizes that the engagement of employee abilities
does not guarantee the application of those abilities towards achieving
performance results.

2.5 Asecondary objective of the remuneration strategy is therefore to motivate
employees to apply their abilities towards achieving improved individual and
organizational performance. To do so, the Company will reward employees
financially for achieving individual or team performance results.

REMUNERATION PACKAGES

Remuneration rates will be calculated and expressed as Total Package
values. The total package value represents the direct fixed cost of
employment of a particular employee to the Company for a specified period,
generally per month.

Total Cost to Company value is used by management to monitor and
control employment costs. This value includes both fixed and variable
amounts paid to a particular employee over a specified period, generally per
annum. As variable payments are related to variable circumstances, and
therefore cannot be guaranteed, these payments are not included in
calculating remuneration rates for the purpose of appointment, increases or
any other income-based calculation or confirmations.

The Total Cost to Company of an individual employee is determined through
an interactive combination of external and internal factors as illustrated
below and discussed in further detail in the following paragraphs:

4.2 The guaranteed pay portion is based on the rate called for in the market to
attract a person who has the abilities required to perform a particular job
offered by the Company.

4.3 In this case, potential to perform and not performance results is the
determining factor. The level of ability required is generally indicated by the
relative complexity of the activities to be completed. The level of ability
offered is generally indicated by the qualifications and experience held by
the applicant.

4.4 The level of ability offered by the job applicant should always be equal to or
above the level of ability required, and the complexity of the job will
therefore serve to determine the minimum remuneration rate called for.

4.5 Thecomplexity of the job will be assessed by management by evaluating the
Key Performance Areas attached to the position. Such assessment further
allows the Company to ensure that all employees performing jobs of
comparable complexity receive comparable minimum levels — of
remuneration, and it therefore promotes internal equity and pay parity.

5 REMUNERATION INCREASES

5.1 Remuneration rates will be adjusted annually with a percentage increase
determined for the year. Remuneration increases are considered and are
discretionary.

5.2 The annual general increase percentage will be determined by the
Remuneration Committee at the end of each financial year. The Business
reserves the right not to apply annual increases based on the overall
profitability of the Business for the financial year.

5.3. Once the general increase percentage has been determined, individual
increases will be calculated by HR based on individual performance, as
determined by way of a performance management process Key
Performance Indicators MC-F-KPI-013 Depending on the level of
performance achieved, individual increases may vary above or below the
general percentage figure.

5.4 Employees will be advised of the increase proposed in relation to their
performance, during the performance evaluation process, and shall further
receive a written confirmation of the actual increase approved and applied.

5.5 For all employees who have qualified for an increase, this will be effective at
the end of April of each new financial year.

5.6 The business retains the right to apply interim increases or salary
adjustments on an adhoc basis at any point within the year, for any of the
following reasons:

e Employee retention

e Pay parity and alignment

e Increase in scope or complexity of the role

e Secondment

e Alignment to market related salaries in the specific job category

5.7 Variable pay may include the following components:

5.7.1 Merit bonuses:

e Merit bonuses may be paid at the end of each financial year or at the
end of a quarter. The merit bonus system is related to individual,
departmental, and organizational performance and is intended to serve
as an incentive to improve performance.

e Merit bonuses are paid at the discretion of the Board of Directors, and
the payment thereof shall NOT imply any obligation on the part of the
company to pay merit bonuses in similar circumstances in the future.

e Should a merit bonus be paid, it does not become part of the
guaranteed pay, as once guaranteed it no longer serves as an incentive
to future performance.

6 COMMISSION ON SALES

Sales refers to the art of selling (to sell) Macrocomm Group's products or
services to customers and/or clients. The more products and services the
employee sells, the higher the employee commission compensation that will be
payable.

The commission compensation structure will be based upon a target agreed
with the relevant Sales Lead.

On accepting a sales position in Macrocomm, either on joining or in changing
roles, the employee concerned agrees that their salary will be structured using a
two-tiered structure: a guaranteed basic with a variable portion dependent upon
their sales commission earned. The guaranteed basic will be market related
based upon experience and responsibilities and is set at base rate to encourage
the salesperson to actively drive sales to boost his/her salary by the commission
earned from these customer/client deals.

(GPACD); where the commission is 10% of the GPACD Rand Value.

6.1.1 Annuity Deals Commission

This applies to all annuity deals regardless of the contract term;
12/24/36/48/60 months.

The commission is 10% of GPACD (Gross Profit After Customer Discount) of
the monthly revenue based upon the product category as noted above.

This commission is payable on 50% of the contract term per year on the
condition that the customer meets their monthly payment commitments.
This means that for every 6 months of the contract term, the sales team will
receive commission on the deal. This is illustrated below:

Contract Term

(Months)
12 6 months
24 6 months | 6 months
36 6 months | 6months | 6 months
48 6 months | 6months | 6months | 6 months
60 6 months | 6months | 6months | 6months | 6 months

The reason for this is that each salesperson is to build a relationship with
their customers to drive retention and growth, as well as ensure that all
monies receivable per month are paid in full.

6.1.2. Month-to-Month Deals

These are deals where the customer pays upfront for all product hardware
and pays on a monthly subscription, on a month-to-month basis where
there is no contract term agreed.

the subscription on a month-to-month basis, then no commission is
payable to the salesperson.

receive commission of 10% of the GPACD on the monthly revenue in
accordance with the annuity commission principle noted in 6.1.1.

6.1.5 Once-off Deals

The commission payable is 10% of the GPACD of the once-off deal. This
commission is payable a month in arrears after having received full
payment from the customer.

6.2 Salary Structure

Fifth Month, sales target is missed The employee will be called into a

could be employment termination.

As soon as the monthly sales target is achieved, the full annuity commission of
all sales deals will be re-instated with the full amount payable, providing this
happens before the fourth (4°) month of missing the monthly sales target.

If the customer / client terminates their contract, the annuity income for that
specific sales deal will be voided and no longer payable to the salesperson. It is
expected that the salesperson will build a relationship and retain the customer /
client for the term of the contract, and, beyond through renewals

6.3. General principles regarding sales commission:

6.3.1 Commission structures may vary from product to product depending on
the business cost and associated revenue per deal. Commission per deal
is calculated based on the Macrocomm quotation tool.

6.3.2 Commission deals based on 10% of GPACD profit will be calculated
considering all relevant business costs. A calculation of profitability is
based on the PNL, and cost of sales.

6.3.3 Commission is only on full conclusion of deals.

6.3.4 Commission on renewed contracts or contracts where the term has been
extended will be calculated using the same principle based upon the new
PNL for such renewal or extension.

6.3.5 Commission is payable once monies have been received into the business
bank account and verified by finance.

6.3.6 For commission payments larger than R50,000-00, payments will be
made over 2 months. This also reduces the tax liability for the employee.

6.3.7 If a deal is discounted by more than 10%, then the commission
payable is reduced accordingly.

6.3.8 Special deals are deals negotiated by external 3rd parties and the
business and may be subject to a different commission model.

6.3.9 Commission can be, when agreed with sales management, be shared
between salespersons.

6.4 Commission Sharing Between Salespersons

Sales management may agree to a commission sharing arrangement between
salespersons. This arrangement must be in writing (such commission sharing
arrangement must be signed by all salespersons sharing such commission and

by sales management to be valid). In which case commission will be processed
individually for such salespersons who are sharing commission through
Macrocomm’s payroll.

Where it is proven that the salesperson has been negligent in applying
Macrocomm’s pricing, technical and/or service commitment policies or any other
policies or the sale has been secured through unethical means, severe
discounting, or any other means which results in a reduction of Macrocomm
Group's profit margins or tarnishing Macrocomm’s name/ brand on the sale, this
may, at the discretion of sales management, result in non-eligibility for
commission payment or a reduction in the amount of commission to be earned.
including set standard terms and conditions. The said contract shall be reviewed
by all stakeholders. All contracts resulting from a sales activity will comply with
all Macrocomm’s Policies

Any breach of the above clauses may result in disciplinary action under the
disciplinary policies of Macrocomm.

6.5 Commission Tracking

All commission will be tracked by the Sales Manager and Sales Director using the
Commission Tracking spreadsheet (MG-SLS-MSS-CMCLM-TEM 20240801.00 MG
SALES lOT COMMISSION CLAIM TEMPLATE).

6.6 Commission Cancellation

If the sales representative is moved to a new business unit or group company,
then all commission earned on all sales deals will cease to be payable from date
of the new position being effective.

7 MANAGEMENT PREROGATIVE

In the event of any conflict (including between the salesperson’s employment
terms pertaining to commissions due and this Policy), or any disagreement over
the payment, or amount of commission due, the decision of sales management
