BUSINESS INTEGRITY POLICY 
1 
Purpose 
Macrocomm expects their employees to act with honesty, integrity and fairness in all 
spheres of their work and interactions when doing business. Everything we do must be 
judged on whether it would appear ethical and fair to our colleagues, to ourselves and 
to the public.  
Macrocomm and its staff commit to uphold and assist others in upholding the dignity, 
standards, and reputation. Our staff are expected to take all reasonable steps to ensure 
that all steps taken are done so within the principals of sustainable development and 
environmental responsibility. 
Macrocomm and its staff further commit to serving our clients and society in a manner 
which is free of corruption, and to act in the best interests of our clients always, 
notwithstanding that we treat all our stakeholders and each other in a fair manner with 
integrity, good faith, efficiency, competence and in a non-discriminatory manner. 
All staff members MUST complete Business Integrity Policy training as part of their 
induction.

Policy Principles 
Macrocomm and its staff have adopted the following principles in this policy: 
• Macrocomm, its staff and members will neither initiate nor commit corrupt 
practices in any manner or form whatsoever. 
• No Members or staff shall accept or give a bribe whether directly or indirectly, 
and such bribery is constituted as unethical behaviour. 
• Any gifts or rewards above R500 need to be declared to the relevant legal 
representative for review. 
• Acceptance of payment or remuneration not to allow for impartial judgement is 
considered as unethical practice. 
• Employees must disclose any interest in any other business, undertaking, 
institution or participation in any other activity that may result in a conflict or 
potential conflict of interest with Macrocomm.  
• All staff are responsible for familiarising themselves with local laws and client 
policies regarding corruption and should report any criminal behaviour to the 
relevant authorities. 
• Confidentiality is of the highest importance and all staff are to work 
professionally, in good faith and have a duty to protect confidential information
