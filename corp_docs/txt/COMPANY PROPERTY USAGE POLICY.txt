1 Purpose

Macrocomm has developed this policy to ensure that all company assets are
protected and used correctly for the scope its intended to. The purpose of this
policy is to ensure that all property maintained by Macrocomm is kept in the best
possible working condition and to ensure proper use of such property and
Macrocomm networks,

"Property," as the term is used in this policy, is defined as any piece of equipment,
furnishing, vehicle, building or supply leased, owned, donated or otherwise in the
custodial care of Macrocomm or any person acting as its agent.

No Macrocomm employee should expect any privacy on Macrocomm premises
or when using Macrocomm property or networks, except that which is required
by law.

1.1 Responsibility and Authority

Management will apply and enforce this policy to ensure a harmonious working
environment characterised by fairness and equality. Furthermore, it will be a joint
effort between management and employees to ensure that all employees are
aware of the company’s anti-discrimination policy and practices. The policy will be
accessible through various internal communication channels including, but not
limited to, the shared drive and hard copies.

1.2 Policy Scope

All Macrocomm Group permanent employees, including employees within
subsidiaries and service lines, and acquisition companies.

2 Policy summary

fashion and follow all Macrocomm rules to ensure its proper use and

employee's misuse of Macrocomm’s property damages the property,
Macrocomm reserves the right to require the employee to pay all or part of the
cost to repair or replace the property. As per the company’s disciplinary code,

misappropriation of Macrocomm property is grounds for immediate termination
and possible criminal action.

No employee may use Macrocomm property (including but not limited to
computers, telephones, cell phones, copiers, Internet services and printers) for
personal use unless specific permission has been granted by the employee's
department head. If such permission is granted, the employee will be responsible
for the care and return of the loaned property. Special care should be taken to
identify any concerns regarding its condition before the property is removed or
used by the employee for personal use.

2.1 Use of Company Vehicles

Any employee for whom driving is an essential job duty must be authorized and
approved by the General Manager to drive Macrocomm vehicles. It is the
responsibility of the employee driver of a Macrocomm vehicle to ensure that the
vehicle is in full operational condition before each use. The employee driver will
sign a vehicle log report noting any problems with, or damage to, the vehicle
before each use. Should the employee return the vehicle to the company with
damage to the vehicle, the vehicle log report will be used as support evidence of
the condition of the vehicle before it was used by the employee driver. Any vehicle
found to be unsafe will be removed from the operational fleet until appropriate
maintenance or repairs have occurred.

If an employee gets a speeding fine whilst driving a company vehicle, this will be
for the employee's account. Information will be verified against the logbook for
the time period. The employee will be informed of the traffic violation and may
agree to a salary deduction or full payment of the fine, depending on the amount.

2.2 Use and Dissemination of Company Information

"Information," as the term is used in this policy, includes without limitation any
information owned or used by Macrocomm such as:

e Any company employee, customer or client lists.

e Any company database information, including addresses and
telephone numbers.

e Any information from Macrocomm employee personnel files, including
employee addresses, telephone numbers, employment status and
salary information.

e Any photographs, videotapes and sound clips of any Macrocomm
employee, customer or client.

Only those employees who are authorized by Macrocomm’s board of directors or
executive team, or whose job description permits them to do so, may speak on
behalf of Macrocomm. Notwithstanding the foregoing, specific permission from
Macrocomm’'s board of directors or executive team will be required before any
employee may disseminate confidential information.

No employee may knowingly dispense such information to any outside party
unless authorization has been granted. This could include other employees who
do not have the right to know such information. Any breach will be considered a
violation of Macrocomm’s policy concerning confidentiality.

2.3 Monitoring of Network Communications

Macrocomm reserves the right to monitor at any time any communications that
use Macrocomm networks in any way, including data, voice mail, email, telephone
logs, Internet use and network traffic, to determine proper use.

Macrocomm will review network communications activity and will analyze use
patterns.

No employee may knowingly disable any network software or system identified
as a monitoring tool.

3 Loss or damage to company property
3.1 Unauthorised use of company property

The unauthorised use of company property may be a form of theft; however, the
offence is wider than theft in the technical sense because it does not require the
employee to have actually taken possession of the employer's property or
alternatively deprived the employer of use of that property. In the case of any
unauthorised use of company property which results in damage or loss, the full
retail value of the item will be deducted from the employee's salary over an agreed
period of time. The employee will be required to complete the Macrocomm Loan
agreement, stipulating the payback period. The total amount of the debt will not
exceed the actual amount of the loss or damage.

The employee will also have the option to replace the device with a new device at
the same value. The make, model and spec of the device should be on par with

the lost or broken device. The replacement device will become the property of
Macrocomm thereafter.

In the case of negligent behaviour, the standard disciplinary process will ensue to
address the breach of company rules.

In all cases where there is no clear admission of guilt, Macrocomm will follow a
fair procedure and give the employee a reasonable opportunity to show why the
deductions should not be made.

3.2 Loss of company devices - No fault of the employee

In the case of loss of a company asset due to no fault of the employee, the
company will replace the asset, on receipt of evidentiary support e.g. a valid police
case number. Replacement will be managed through the insurance process if
applicable.

Should an employee lose a company device for a second time during the
employment period, they will be liable for replacement of the device. If there was
a previous loss of any company device, the employee is liable for either
replacement of the new device or pay-back based on the amount initially paid by
the company. If the asset is insured, the employee will be liable for the insurance
excess payment for replacement of the device.

3.3 Stolen company vehicle

In the case of a company vehicle being stolen or written off, the company will
conclude its own investigation. Should the incident investigation show no fault of
the employee, the company will proceed with the standard process related to
insurance claims.

Should there be foul play suspected and/or proven, the company reserves its
rights to proceed with criminal charges, together with application of the
company’s disciplinary process.
