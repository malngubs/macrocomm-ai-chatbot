1 Purpose

This policy outlines the guidelines for the use of company-issued petrol cards,
ensuring responsible and ethical usage for business purposes only. Company-
issued petrol cards are not part of a travel allowance but rather for use by
employees who are appointed drivers of company vehicles for various projects as
allocated by the General Manager.

The policy aims to prevent misuse, maintain accountability, and comply with
company and legal regulations.

2 Scope

This policy applies to all employees who use a company vehicle. Each company
vehicle has a petrol card issued to it. The company does not issue a petrol card to
an employee, rather each petrol card is linked to a specific vehicle. This means that
each petrol card can only be used to put in fuel for a specific company car.

This policy only covers fuel transactions made using a petrol card. Toll-fees are paid
for using cash given to each employee as part of their travel float per project. All
repairs and maintenance costs are paid for by the company to the appointed
dealer; this includes oil.

3 Definitions

Employee - a staff member who is employed by Macrocomm Group or Related-Party
Group Company, on a permanent or fixed term contract basis.

Consultant - An independent individual on a monthly retainer paid for by the
company, for a specific role or project.

Company-issued petrol cards - are bank petrol cards which are generic to
Macrocomm Group and with each card linked to a specific company car.

Company car - a company owned vehicle that forms part of the company vehicle
pool that is allocated according to project requirements as necessary.

4 Eligibility

Employees and consultants eligible and allocated the use of a company car must
use the petrol card linked to that specific vehicle. This must be authorized by their
Direct Reporting Manager and the General Manager.

The card is for business use only and may not be used for personal or unauthorized
purchases.
