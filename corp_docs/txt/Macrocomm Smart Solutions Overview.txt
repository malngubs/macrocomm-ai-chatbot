KPI / OKR Management Tool & Dashboard

This module centralises objectives, key results and
performance indicators into a single, visual dashboard
that drives alignment across teams. It lets managers set
strategic OKRs, cascade them to operational KPls, and
track progress in real time with traffic-light health
indicators, trend charts and automated alerts when
targets deviate. Integrations pull data from operations,
loT devices and finance so the dashboard always reflects
live performance.

Training, Coaching, Mentoring

A continuous learning engine that delivers role-based
learning paths, microlearning modules, scheduled
coaching sessions and mentor matching for drivers and
operations staff. It ties training progress to KPIs (e.g.,
hygiene checklist pass rate, on-time deliveries) and
supports assessments, certifications and refresher
nudges so competence is measurable and repeatable.
Trainers can push updates (new SOPs, short videos) and
monitor skill gaps to target coaching where it matters
most.

Analytics and Reporting

Analytics pulls together operational, customer and
sensor data into customizable reports and dashboards,
from daily hygiene compliance rates to route
performance and spoilage incidents. Advanced
capabilities include scheduled reports, ad-hoc drilldowns,
cohort analyses and simple predictive models (e.g.,
probability of temperature excursions). Exportable
evidence packages support audits and stakeholder
updates.

Financial Management & Budget Tracking

This module tracks costs, revenues and budgets at
multiple levels (per driver, per route, per client) and ties
financial outcomes to operational inputs (fuel, spoilage,

maintenance). Features include real-time expense
logging, budget vs actual dashboards, automated
invoicing templates and scenario forecasting to test
margin impacts of routing or temperature control
changes. Alerts flag budget overruns and variance
drivers so finance and ops can act quickly.

Smart Services

Smart Services is the loT and automation layer:
thermostatic logging for delivery boxes, remote
telemetry (door status, battery, shocks), automated
route optimisation, and predictive maintenance for
equipment. It enables rules (e.g., hold delivery if
temperature out of range), real-time notifications to
drivers/customers, and API hooks for third-party devices
(smart locks, thermal sensors). The result is consistent
product condition and automated service guarantees.

Knowledge Management

A searchable, versioned knowledge base containing
SOPs, checklists, how-to videos, incident post-mortems
and regulatory documents. It links training modules to
SOPs, stores audit trails (who read/acknowledged which
procedure) and supports quick creation of localized
guides for specific clients or regions. Feedback loops
allow frontline staff to suggest improvements, and
governance ensures only current, approved docs are in
circulation.

Continuous Al Camera Monitoring

Fixed Al-backed cameras installed at the school
automatically detect and recognise learners
during normal daily activities (arrivals, classes,
assemblies, break times).

The system captures multiple sightings over the
day, week, and month to build a verification
record.

This reduces reliance on single-day checks and
improves accuracy in identifying consistently
attending learners.
