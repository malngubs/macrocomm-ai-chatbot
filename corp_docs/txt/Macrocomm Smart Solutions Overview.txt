KPI / OKR Management Tool & Dashboard
This module centralises objectives, key results and 
performance indicators into a single, visual dashboard 
that drives alignment across teams. It lets managers set 
strategic OKRs, cascade them to operational KPIs, and 
track progress in real time with traffic-light health 
indicators, trend charts and automated alerts when 
targets deviate. Integrations pull data from operations, 
IoT devices and finance so the dashboard always reflects 
live performance.
Training, Coaching, Mentoring
A continuous learning engine that delivers role-based 
learning paths, microlearning modules, scheduled 
coaching sessions and mentor matching for drivers and 
operations staff. It ties training progress to KPIs (e.g., 
hygiene checklist pass rate, on-time deliveries) and 
supports assessments, certifications and refresher 
nudges so competence is measurable and repeatable. 
Trainers can push updates (new SOPs, short videos) and 
monitor skill gaps to target coaching where it matters 
most.
Analytics and Reporting
Analytics pulls together operational, customer and 
sensor data into customizable reports and dashboards, 
from daily hygiene compliance rates to route 
performance and spoilage incidents. Advanced 
capabilities include scheduled reports, ad-hoc drilldowns, 
cohort analyses and simple predictive models (e.g., 
probability of temperature excursions). Exportable 
evidence packages support audits and stakeholder 
updates.
Financial Management & Budget Tracking
This module tracks costs, revenues and budgets at 
multiple levels (per driver, per route, per client) and ties 
financial outcomes to operational inputs (fuel, spoilage, 
maintenance). Features include real-time expense 
logging, budget vs actual dashboards, automated 
invoicing templates and scenario forecasting to test 
margin impacts of routing or temperature control 
changes. Alerts flag budget overruns and variance 
drivers so finance and ops can act quickly.
Smart Services
Smart Services is the IoT and automation layer: 
thermostatic logging for delivery boxes, remote 
telemetry (door status, battery, shocks), automated 
route optimisation, and predictive maintenance for 
equipment. It enables rules (e.g., hold delivery if 
temperature out of range), real-time notifications to 
drivers/customers, and API hooks for third-party devices 
(smart locks, thermal sensors). The result is consistent 
product condition and automated service guarantees.
Knowledge Management
A searchable, versioned knowledge base containing 
SOPs, checklists, how-to videos, incident post-mortems 
and regulatory documents. It links training modules to 
SOPs, stores audit trails (who read/acknowledged which 
procedure) and supports quick creation of localized 
guides for specific clients or regions. Feedback loops 
allow frontline staff to suggest improvements, and 
governance ensures only current, approved docs are in 
circulation.

Learner Verification System
South Africa’s school funding system reportedly suffers significant losses each year. 
This misrepresentation diverts critical resources from learners who need them most, 
leading to inefficiencies, financial waste, and a lack of trust in the public education 
sector.
Traditional systems often fall short due to the need for human intervention and the 
lack of real-time accuracy. This proposal presents an AI camera solution that ensures 
secure, fixed, and non-invasive authentication using facial verification. 
By leveraging AI technology via camera devices and advanced recognition software, 
the system ensures: 
•
Verifiable learner attendance linked to funding
•
Enhanced mobility for real-time attendance capture
•
Reduced fraud and improved trust
•
Scalable implementation across rural and urban schools 
Solution 
Highlights
❑
Accurate Attendance: Schools can receive funding 
that will be based on real, verifiable attendance, 
preventing alleged fraudulent claims without any 
human intervention.
❑
Reduced Fraud and Misuse: AI-driven verification 
eliminates the possibility of false reporting through 
identifying registered learners.
❑
Enhanced Transparency and Trust: Real-time 
monitoring fosters accountability within the 
education sector. 
❑
Improved Resource Distribution: Directs funds to 
schools based on actual needs, ensuring learners 
receive the support they deserve.
❑
National / Provincial Analysis Reporting: 
National / Provincial report on how many learner 
anomalies based on lack of attendance.
❑
Integration and Trend Reports: We will also 
provide statistics per region based on attendance 
trends for learners, reporting on red flags based on 
your specified business rules.

Continuous AI Camera Monitoring
•
Fixed AI-backed cameras installed at the school 
automatically detect and recognise learners 
during normal daily activities (arrivals, classes, 
assemblies, break times).
•
The system captures multiple sightings over the 
day, week, and month to build a verification 
record.
•
This reduces reliance on single-day checks and 
improves accuracy in identifying consistently 
attending learners.
Learner Verification
•
The AI verification system processes the 
captured images and matches them against the 
official learner database.
•
Learners consistently detected are 
automatically marked as Verified Learners.
•
This automated verification ensures only 
eligible students are recognised for the 
program, minimising human error or 
manipulation.
Connectivity to Servers
•
The device connects via Terrestrial and 
VSAT connections (satellite or ground 
internet) to the central system.
•
This connection allows the device to 
communicate with the AI-backed camera 
server that:
•
Accesses the learner database
•
Runs the verification request
•
Confirms the learner’s identity.
Cloud Server Integration
•
Verified learner data is sent to the Cloud 
Server.
•
The cloud server acts as the central 
repository and processing point for all 
collected school data.
Back Office / HQ Reporting
•
The Back Office / HQ accesses reports 
from the cloud.
•
These reports contain lists of all verified 
learners from each school.
•
The system ensures reports are accurate 
before proceeding to grant disbursement.
Grant Payment Process
•
Once verified learner lists are approved at 
HQ, grants are paid out to the appropriate 
schools or beneficiaries.
•
The circular connection between HQ and 
the payment process shows that 
payments are only made after data 
validation.
