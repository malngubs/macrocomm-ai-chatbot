Solution Overview Document 
Introduction 
This document provides an in-depth overview of various monitoring and metering systems, 
including JoJo Tank Sensors, Electricity Meters, Water Meters, Diesel Monitoring, and Gas Meters. 
Each of these systems is designed with speciﬁc capabilities to oﬀer monitoring, accurate reporting, 
and eﬃcient resource management. By leveraging these technologies, businesses can optimise 
their utility consumption, enhance operational eﬃciency, and ensure accurate billing and cost 
allocation. 
The integration of these systems into a uniﬁed platform enables seamless data collection, analysis, 
and visualization, empowering users with insights for informed decision-making. This document 
explores the features, functionalities, and interdependencies of these monitoring solutions to 
provide a comprehensive understanding of their role in resource management. 
 
1. JoJo Tank Sensor 
The JoJo Tank Sensor is a water level monitoring system designed to ensure eﬃcient water storage 
and consumption management. By utilising ultrasonic sensing technology, it provides timely 
insights into tank levels, helping users prevent shortages, optimise water use, and reduce wastage. 
Key Features: 
 
Level Status Monitoring: Uses ultrasonic sensors to track water levels at set intervals. 
 
Threshold Alerts: Customisable triggers (e.g., low water level at 10%) sent via email or 
SMS. 
 
Consumption Analysis: Tracks historical data to identify patterns and trends in water 
usage. 
 
Integration Capabilities: Compatible with IoT platforms for centralised monitoring 
and automation. 
2. Electricity Meter 
Electricity meters play a crucial role in tracking power usage and optimising energy consumption. 
These meters provide real-time insights into electricity usage patterns, allowing users to adjust 
consumption habits and manage costs eﬀectively. 
Key Features: 
 
Time-of-Use (ToU) Analysis: Enables users to shift energy consumption to oﬀ-peak hours, 
reducing costs (e.g., R0.50/kWh oﬀ-peak vs. R2.50/kWh peak). 
 
Billing & Cost Allocation: Automates cost distribution across tenants or departments with 
detailed PDF reports and generates an Electricity bill. 
 
Real-Time Monitoring: Tracks electricity usage per circuit or device, identifying 
ineﬃciencies.
