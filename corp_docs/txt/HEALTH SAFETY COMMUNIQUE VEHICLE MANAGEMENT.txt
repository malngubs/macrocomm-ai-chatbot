At Macrocomm, we expect all employees to maintain a clean and orderly work 
environment and to use company property responsibly. Misuse or neglect of company 
property may result in disciplinary action, including termination, and employees may be 
required to cover repair or replacement costs. Personal use of company property is only 
allowed with prior permission. 
 
Company Vehicles 
Only authorized employees may drive company vehicles. Employees must ensure the 
vehicle is in good condition and log any damage. If a traffic fine is issued while driving a 
company vehicle, it will be the employee’s responsibility, and the fine may be deducted 
from their salary. 
 
Stolen or Written-Off Company Vehicle. 
If a company vehicle is stolen or written off, the company will investigate. If the employee 
is not at fault, the insurance claim will proceed. If foul play is suspected, the company may 
pursue criminal charges and disciplinary action.
