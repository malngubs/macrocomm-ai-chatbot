Background 
Municipalities are faced with a major backlog of unpaid utility services resulting in revenue 
shortages. This is primarily due to billing discrepancy disputes and reduced revenue collection due 
to interim billing, a direct result of aging infrastructure and in-accurate consumption figures as 
well as many unbilled points.  
The replacement of legacy metering infrastructure with Smart metering for both Electricity and 
Water will provide an increase in accurate electricity and water consumption data in real-time, for 
billing purposes, facilitating a reduction in monthly municipal interim billing and a noticeable 
improvement in revenue collection. This coupled with smart prepaid metering, which focuses on 
ensuring that bypasses and ghost vending are eradicated, will ensure financial viability of 
municipalities. 
Thanks to our wildly innovative Internet of Things (IoT) solutions, many Smart Cities are already 
active and deploying rapidly. All spheres of government can leverage cellular and Low Power Wide 
Area Network (LPWAN) IoT technologies such as NB-IoT, Sigfox, and Lora WAN to connect and 
improve infrastructure, improve efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance convenience and quality of 
life for citizens.

Comprehensive Solution Offering  
Due to our extensive experience in the smart municipal utility management space, we have 
developed systems and solutions that add value to our clientele. We believe that through constant 
system and solution research, development, and improvements, we can ensure that governments 
operate at optimal utility management standards while maintaining service delivery commitments 
and optimising revenue management in their utility management operational stream.  
 
Macrocomm will provide an end-to-end service for hardware supply, field installation & project 
management, AMR services, vending & collection services, and SLA & maintenance contracts as 
part of the smart metering solution. The process on how this will be achieved has been stated 
below: 
 
Auditing and Data Cleansing 
We start with an audit service that is included in the overall solution. This focuses on 
understanding the key challenges faced in the revenue management of the institution. We are 
able to identify major areas that can be quickly fixed to make a difference to the government 
institution and focus on these areas as the first phase of the project. 
 
Resolution of current disputes 
All government institutions are faced with disputed accounts daily. Through a national contact 
centre or a consumer engagement smart phone application, teams can address consumer queries 
and deploy trained staff to address disputes, driving revenue recovery and creating a culture of 
payment adoption through accurate and trusted billing. 
 
 

  
 
P a g e  8 | 9 
Tariff correction and alignment 
The implementation of approved tariffs, appropriately aligned to customer accounts, is key for 
revenue enhancement. Data analytics will identify the correct customer allocations ensuring 
accurate billing and tariff alignment.  
 
Revenue recovery 
Government institutions are faced with billions of historical debt. As part of our Value-Added 
Services (VAS), we will implement the debt recovery regulations and manage the full recovery 
process.  
 
Revenue enhancement - LPU reconstruction  
Large Power Users are the highest revenue-contributing customers of any government institution. 
As part of the VAS, our teams will focus on these customers to ensure the accuracy & correctness 
of the AMI. (Automatic Meter Infrastructure) 
 
Statistical Metering solutions 
Ensuring a healthy network infrastructure is key to any distribution. The solution will focus on a 
turnkey methodology by managing incomers, substations, kiosks, and end supply points. This 
provides insights into technical and non-technical loses, allowing municipalities to take corrective 
action. 
 
Energy Storage Solutions 
Generation and storage in these networks become key in ensuring constant quality supply. 
Storage is a major contributor to revenue enhancement based on TOU tariff management.  
 
Supply of Hardware 
With our supplier agreements with leading hardware OEM partners, we can provide superior 
quality accredited products at cost-effective pricing. Electricity & Water meters will support 
GSM/LTE & NB-IoT modules. Our experience in the field and working at mass has taught us the 
hardware with individual communication modules is much more effective than concentrator type 
on PLC. This is primarily due to communication problems experienced by the latter.  
 
Automatic Meter Reading (AMR) services 
AMR services are the only way of effectively monitoring and managing all revenue interventions 
or programs. AMR services provide real-time alerts on all possible exceptions that may arise and 
enable government institutions to not only protect current but also future revenue. Effective 
budget and financial forecasting is facilitated with this process. 
 
Vending & collection services 
 
• 
We will deploy a full vending solution to drive revenue collection. 
• 
The vending solution will be linked to the AMR system and the monitoring of token 
purchases against consumption patterns, in real time, can identify possible ghost vending. 
• 
Alerts for partial or complete by-passes and equipment tampering is also reported on the 
AMR platform.   
• 
We have implemented numerous collection gateways for government institutions, 
including secure online or infield payment channels and smart wallets. 
• 
Money is securely collected and transferred to the various government institutions at 
agreed timeframes, thereby assisting with cashflow management.
