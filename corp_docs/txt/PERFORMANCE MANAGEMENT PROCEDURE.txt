1.1 Description 
The report details the new performance documents to be utilized and proposed 
timelines for implementation of the new performance process, in co-ordination 
with the business financial year. 
1.2 Benefits 
Performance Management is how we manage, support and ensure the 
performance of teams and individuals against goals through clear and individual 
accountabilities.  It is a system which can support pay decisions, promotion

standardised within the business, enabling improved, accurate and aligned 
business information. 
o Approved goals are measurable and impact focussed, and are linked to the 
strategic objectives of Macrocomm. All KPI’s will be based on the goals of the 
CEO.

against agreed outcomes are annually rated by their manager.

• 
To identify when someone is ready for promotion or possibly to be placed in a 
more appropriate role 
• 
To identify if someone is not meeting the standards of the organisation, and how 
to assist them. 
2.1.2 
Procedure Metrics 
Each objective of this procedure is measured according to the: 
• 
Formal reviews are used to track progress on individuals using a weighting system, 
with the following rating scale used for effectiveness: 
o 1 = Individual performance consistently does not meet expectations on the 
What and the How of delivery against customer, job and goal requirements. 
o 2 = On balance, individual performance does not fully meet expectations.  
Improvement is required in the What and/or the How related to delivery 
against customer and goal requirements. 
o 3 = On balance, individual performance fully meets expectations.  Both the 
What and the How is achieved in the delivery against customer and goal 
requirements. 
o 4 = On balance, individual performance fully meets and occasionally exceeds 
customer and goal requirements on the What and the How.   
o 5 = On balance, individual performance fully meets expectations and 
frequently exceeds customer and goal requirements on both the What and 
the How. 
o 6 = Individual performance consistently exceeds customer and goal 
requirements on both the What and the How. 
• 
These reviews take place twice a year, in September (Mid-year reviews) and 
February (Final review). 
• 
The mid-year performance discussion is used to determine how an employee is 
tracking against full-year goals and is used as an opportunity to provide coaching 
and feedback to improve performance areas prior to year-end.  
• 
At the annual review, a final performance rating for the year is agreed.  This feeds 
into the remuneration process.

2.2.2

Strategic, Legal and Personnel Implications 
6.1 Strategic Implications: 
6.1.1 
Properly cascaded CEO goals will help to translate into business results. 
6.1.2 
Alignment of acquisition companies to the Group performance process will 
ensure standardisation of process and transferability of performance ratings 
across businesses.

People and divisions are held accountable for business performance, with 
significant impacts to salaries and funding if not aligned.  
6.2 Legal/Statutory Implications: 
6.2.1 
Consider implications of managing the performance of acquisition companies 
6.3 Staff/Personnel Implications: 
6.3.1 
Key people decisions, succession, promotion, development, and increases, will 
be based on clear evidence of performance. 
6.3.2 
Non-performance is managed via an approved poor performance process. 
Should an employee not be performing to the required standard, the manager 
is requested to embark on a performance evaluation and/or improvement 
process. The implications of non-improvement is dismissal.  
6.3.3 
Non delivery in business-critical roles and funded service lines will result in an 
extraction of funds if the business targets are not met continuously within a 3-
month period.  
6.4 Financial Implications: 
6.4.1 
At the annual review, a final performance rating for the year is agreed.  This feeds 
into the remuneration process. The business needs to budget for performance 
bonuses, and performance aligned increases.
