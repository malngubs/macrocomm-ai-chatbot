1 Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to:
e Describe the types of expenditures that are reimbursable by the Company.

e Inform employees of their responsibilities to control and report travel and
entertainment.

e Describe the process for an employee to file and obtain travel expenses
and reimbursement.

2 Objectives

The objective of this Policy is to set out the travel and accommodation guidelines
to employees who participate in Company business away from their specified
office.

3 .-=SOA@ir Travel

All air travel is to be pre-approved by the designated head in each Business Unit
and CEO. The Travel and Accommodation Pre-Approval Request Form (MG-FIN-
FRM-TRV 202408.05 MG FINANCE PREAPPROVAL TRAVEL REQUEST FORM) needs
to be completed and signed off prior to any business travel. All domestic air travel
is to be planned and must maximize client working hours. Travel to clients must
be considered only after all other options have been considered e.g., virtual
meetings, combined meetings etc.

3.1. Domestic air travel
All employees travel economy class.
3.2. International air travel

This travel will also be economy unless specifically approved based on valid
reasons by the CEO.

4 Car Hire

When required, a car rental company vehicle (category B or equivalent) will be
hired through either the procurement department or CEO's office for business
related travel. The procurement department will finalise the booking based on the
best available rate, or agreement with suppliers. The normal process is to source

3 quotations from existing preferred suppliers, prior to making a final selection.
Higher category cars will only be by special request to the CEO.

In certain instances, the company may advise for you to use the uber option and
claim a reimbursement from the company. This will be done based on the
discretion of management.

5 Accommodation

Accommodation equal to a tourist class (3star) hotel or a Company approved
hotel or B&B will be supplied at the Company's expense in the event that an
employee is required to be away from home over night and shall be pre-approved
by the relevant manager.

The amount per night for accommodation is capped at R1200 (One thousand, two
hundred rands) per night and will be reviewed annually in line with inflation. For
group travel and accommodation (more than 2 individuals travelling together), the
Company will first get quotations from self-catering apartments through options
such as Air BnB, Hotels.com, Expedia and Agoda Bookings.

Any alternative accommodation which requires company payment is to be
approved by the CEO.

Should the employee make use of friends or a family member for accommodation
purposes away from home whilst on business travel, he/she will be granted a
monetary allowance of R500 (five hundred rands) per night, which is deemed
inclusive of accommodation and excludes all meals.

6 Bookings and Payment

All domestic bookings are to be done via the CEO’s office or procurement
department. Domestic travel arrangement bookings need to be made a minimum
of 3 days in advance. Any changes to the booking after confirmation will have to
be approved by the respective Divisional Head. Where changes were done by the
employee and were not planned for, it will be for the cost of the employee.

7 Subsistence Allowance:
7.1 Domestic allowance

For local travel an employee will be entitled to claim for meals and soft drinks to
the value of up to R380-00 (three hundred and eight rand) per day should
hotel/B&B accommodation be utilized. Employees should exercise reasonable

judgement on drinks consumed. Should an approved lunch or dinner
entertainment or other incidental costs be incurred in excess of the R380-00
(three hundred and eight rand), approval for additional payment may be
requested to the Finance Manager and such may be claimed back from the
Company if approved.

For group travel, for an extended period of time (i.e. more than 4 days), the
Company will apply the option for a grocery allowance as opposed to a daily
subsistence allowance per person. This will be at the discretion of the Company.

7.2 International allowance

As accommodation and flights are prepaid, a relevant currency allowance for
incidentals equal to R1000 (One thousand rand) per day will be granted upfront.
A claim form accompanied by receipts of expenditure will be required on return.
Additional expenditure claims will be refunded on approval by the CEO. All private
expenses are for the account of the employees.

Reimbursed travel claims need to be submitted to the CEO within a 3-month
period of the expense been incurred by the employee. All international expenses
require the approval of the CEO

8 Use of private vehicle for company business

Employees who do not have a structured travel allowance as part of their CTC
package structuring and who travel less than 8000 km per year for pre/post-
approved once-off and or shorter occasional business-related trips, with their
private vehicles, will be entitled to claim reimbursement for the kilometres
travelled. Such claim will be reimbursed at:

e The AA and SARS Rate for each financial year and will be reflected
accordingly as a non-taxable reimbursement on the employee's IRP5. No
logbook is required. The AA and SARS Rate for period 1 March 2025 to 28
Feb 2026 is R4.76/km.

Employees who do business travel in excess of 8000 kilometres per year, may
structure an approved taxable travel allowance as part of their total cost to
company packages (Current SARS travel tax rates are applicable). Such employees
are required to maintain a logbook to be submitted at their annual assessments
with SARS and therefore their IRP5’s will also reflect such reimbursements. This
reimbursement rate will be circulated regularly, based on updates received from
the Automobile Association with fuel or other price movements.

Due consideration must however be taken as to whether travel with private
vehicles has been considered when salary packages were finalised.

In the event of an employee electing to travel by vehicle instead of by air then
reimbursement would be on the same rate per kilometre as outlined above;
however, this cost should not exceed the costs of the air ticket.

An employee undergoing training and who is not in receipt of a car allowance
would also be eligible for reimbursement.

An employee travelling to the airport in order to catch a business flight may:

e Claim the lower of the travel kilometres from home to the airport or the
office to the airport.

e Claim a return trip only, a double return trip is not claimable in the event
that the employee arranged for someone to drop them off at the airport.

9 Reimbursive travel expenses

Reimbursed claims (form: MG-FIN-ECF 202310.00 MG FINANCIAL EXPENSE CLAIM)
need to be submitted within a 3-month period of the expense being incurred by
the employee or else the employee will forfeit the claim.

Employees are required to collate their expenses and after obtaining the relevant
approval from their Manager submit their claim to the Finance Department by the
25th of each month for payment by the 5° of the new month. Should
reimbursement be required sooner, a justification may be lodged with the
General manager, and quicker payment processing considered.

Any other expenditure, including parking and toll fees, that an employee incurred
while away from the employee's specified offices are to be submitted for approval
on the relevant expense claim form. It is the responsibility of the employee
submitting the claim to ensure the total amounts being claimed tally correctly.

The Company will reimburse car parking expenses for a maximum of 3
consecutive days away from home for each business trip. Periods away from
home in excess of the 3 days require the employee to be dropped off at the
airport. All
local expenses require the approval of the relevant Department Manager and
Finance Manager.
