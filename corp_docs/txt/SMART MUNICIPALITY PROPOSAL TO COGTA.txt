Executive Summary 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is helping local governments to operate more efficiently through 
accelerating service delivery, monitoring and measuring of objectives and targets, 
automating and simplifying routine administrative tasks and performing sophisticated 
data analysis to help public officials make more informed decisions.   
There are several use cases for AI in local government such as strategic objective 
monitoring 
and 
project 
management, 
financial 
management, 
smart 
services 
management, road condition management, urban planning and development, public 
safety and law enforcement, education and workforce development, community 
engagement, 
healthcare 
and 
social 
services, 
environmental 
monitoring 
and 
management, emergency response and disaster management, traffic management and 
transportation and citizen services. 
The CoGTA District Development Model (DDM) has been designed and implemented to 
specifically address problems with service delivery by allowing all spheres of government, 
from local municipalities to national government, to work together collaboratively and 
effectively.  The DDM provides oversight through assisting local municipalities to plan, 
budget and implement projects and programmes more effectively. It aids municipalities 
to monitor, measure and manage capably and productively.

analytics dashboards and scorecards.  This synergy allows for a standardisation of 
technology by facilitating the different software platforms information to be accessible 
across departments, providing real-time dashboard updates for pro-active management 
and maintenance of government services for high-quality service delivery, and enabling 
effective knowledge management and record keeping.

Introduction 
The Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (CoGTA) Department 
has the unenviable role to lead local government through enabling municipalities to 
deliver on services of the pre-determined and agreed quality and standard, ensure good 
governance, build institutional resilience and administrative capability.  The primary tool 
to drive delivery of national government’s objectives and targets for South Africa is the 
District Development Model. 
MacrocommAI Unity© leverages core machine and deep learning technologies, data 
integration and real-time analytics which enable automation of dashboards, scorecards, 
alerts through centralising data for analytics and predictive modelling to promote service 
delivery efficacy, cost reductions and informed decision making.  This facilitation of strong 
operations and processes to manage the local government infrastructure and services to 
meet socio-economic needs of its citizens offers the DDM the oversight required. 
In 2019, the District Development Model (DDM) and it’s One Plan was initiated.  The DDM 
has the primary responsibility to direct and improve integrated planning and delivery 
across the three spheres of government. 
The Government of National Unity (GNU) has emphasised the need for every municipality 
to work effectively to regain public trust and fulfil government’s constitutional obligations.  
The DDM is to actively oversee, guide and champion integrated planning which has been 
identified as a critical strategy for remove silos and foster collaboration across 
government and society through 6 (six) transformative principles to guide and inform 
each Local Government’s One Plan. 
 
Figure 2: District Development Model (DDM) Transformative Principles that inform each Local Government's One 
Plan 
The Local Government’s Integrated Development Plan (IDP) and the DDM One Plan are 
interrelated.  The IDP sets out the long-terms goals, strategies and projects for the local 
government (municipality level) whilst the DDM integrates these with the larger provincial 
and national government objectives.  The IDP informs the local government’s One Plan

with insight into the local needs and priorities.  All these different plans and goals can be 
digitised and incorporated into the MacrocommAI Unity© platform allowing for integrity 
in measuring, monitoring, actioning and reporting across all government spheres.

Problem Statement 
Local government (municipalities) faces a growing crisis of governance and service 
delivery characterised by financial mismanagement, corruption, infrastructure decay, 
poor service delivery, lack of urban planning, technical and institutional capabilities, and 
growing public distrust and frustration.  These persistent ills and increasing risks 
undermine their ability to meet their constitutional mandate. threatening social cohesion 
and widening inequalities. 
The primary issues municipalities are having to tackle head-on are: 
• Financial 
Mismanagement 
& Instability 
• Governance and 
Corruption 
• Service Delivery 
Failures 
• Lack of Capacity 
and Skills 
• Aging and Poorly 
Maintained 
Infrastructure 
• Urbanization and 
Housing Pressure 
• Social Unrest and 
Community 
Protests 
• Climate and 
Environmental 
Vulnerabilities 
 
The DDM aids municipalities in address these issues through integrated, cooperative 
governance at the local government level, oversight and direct guidance.  
The DDM adds to the complexity of governance structures, duplication and bureaucracy 
for the provincial and local government bodies which creates barriers for adoption and 
implementation.  Stakeholders struggle with the DDM hubs mandates, roles and 
responsibilities, and their inability to measure its performance, and value contribution.   
 
Figure 3:  The three (3) spheres of government and how the DDM has been envisaged to build a central repository 
and standard across these

This impacts the budgetary requirements for the DDM as the potential for corruption 
exists, and the fear that monies for various key projects will be diverted disempowering 
local governments to achieve their commitments to their constituencies.   
The lack of capacity and technical skills within municipalities hinders the delivery of 
quality services, and the lack of accountability and oversight often lead to 
mismanagement and can result in corruption.  
The local government systemic service delivery failure has left many communities without 
reliable access to water, sanitation, electricity, and waste management.   
For the DDM to achieve its goals of improved service delivery, integrated planning, and 
sustainable development, it must address these critical challenges.  This will require a 
robust artificial intelligence platform to facilitate integrated governance through 
dashboards, scorecards, analytics and predictive modelling. 
There are 161 municipalities that are at medium risk of instability and financial distress; 
representing 63% of South Africa’s local government.  This is high vulnerability especially 
if we consider that only 61 (24%) are deemed stable.  The other 196 municipalities status 
of distressed and medium risk require government oversight to monitor, support and 
assist to prevent further decline and inability to serve their citizens.  These municipalities 
have financial and local government mismanagement, poor financial planning and 
governance, and lack service delivery.

municipalities are medium risks. Source: DCoG Strategic Plan for 2025-2030

Figure 5: MacrocommAI Unity Platform Driving Integrated Solutions and Governance 
CoGTA and the DDM have a need for smarter governance, enabled by real-time data, 
artificial intelligence, and systemic accountability to help rebuild public trust and meet 
the government’s objectives for South Africa.  Municipalities need a solution that 
transforms governance into a transparent, data-driven system, with early warning, 
shared accountability, and performance visibility at its core.   
 
 
Figure 6  MacrocommAI Unity© offers service governance aligning with government strategy, offering high value 
and requiring a skilled team for an intermediate level implementation 
MacrocommAI starts with financial, performance and service governance as the first step 
towards an AI Smart Municipality Solution by promoting higher productivity and enabling

citizen services.  This AI Solution ensures strategic alignment with CoGTA and National 
Treasury objectives regarding the DDM, offers high value with ease of access to 
information, analytics, scorecards, dashboards and the ability to model using predictive 
analytics.   MacrocommAI Unity© is an empowering solution that will aid the DDM to 
oversee, guide and direct municipalities to meet respective and national objectives and 
targets. 
Once this governance structure is in place, it is easier to incorporate other AI Tools 
regarding key service delivery areas such as traffic management, health care, urban 
planning amongst key services due to the modular structure of MacrocommAI’s 
Solutions. 
MacrocommAI Unity© enables local-, provincial- and national government officials to 
monitor and measure for modernisation of the municipality, enhancements and 
streamlining of processes the identified key performance indicators (KPI’s) such as: 
• 
Services 
o 
Waste collection turnaround time, bin capacity, tonnage collected per 
route, fuel efficiency, missed pick up rate 
o 
Road conditions, visual condition index, pothole density, potholes 
repaired, road infrastructure damage (curbs, storm drains, traffic signs) 
o 
Traffic light queue length, near misses, cables stolen, uptime 
(active/inactive), repaired, malfunction frequency, delays, travel time 
• 
Financial 
o 
Revenue earned from different utilities such as water, electricity; 
expenditure on different projects and key maintenance areas, and 
departmental costs; budget vs actual; debt and cashflow management. 
The modular structure of MacrocommAI Unity©  allows for the integration and 
incorporation of the different municipal software systems/tools such as the Potholefixgp 
or SAMRAS, SOLAR, Munsoft, EnerGov, MetVal, and CityView;  which help them with 
financial management, property and revenue management, public works, and overall 
operational efficiency.

Figure 7: MacrocommAI Unity© - A simple overview of the blueprint 
Once the core governance and oversight platform is deployed, the implementation is 
intermediate and requires a well-skilled team from government to help drive the set-up 
of MacrocommAI Unity©.  The priority would be agreed for the incorporation which may 
be to start with the financial systems or operational efficiency systems (CityView).  
4.1 Smart Municipalities Start with Service Governance Excellence 
MacrocommAI offers a powerful AI-first approach to financial, performance and service 
governance that leverages AI algorithms to expedite routine processes saving 
government officials time and freeing them to focus on execution and analytics for 
streamlining and enhancing processes for service delivery.  
Unity© ,a real-time monitoring system that aligns municipal performance with national 
service delivery objectives, using data provides a tool of accountability and 
transformation that facilitates the rolling up to a national level for the much-needed 
collaboration and support across all government spheres.   
CoGTA and the DDM through Unity© will be able to provide the required oversight to 
guide municipal activities, monitor implementation of policies, drive accountability to the 
community and ensure corrective action as mandated. 
The Smart Municipality Solution uses a modular, scalable framework using foundational 
components designed to address specific gaps in governance; from aligning national KPIs 
with local outputs to monitoring citizen impact in real time.  It aligns service delivery with 
measurable Key Performance Indicators (KPI) tied to national government priorities.  
This is embedded within MacrocommAI’s intelligent platform, which connects 
departments, tracks data in real time, and applies AI to highlight risks, trends, and 
performance outcomes. This turns fragmented operations into an intelligent, unified 
system of action, and enables the predictability modelling functionality for local

government and the DDM to prepare for various possible scenarios, making it a powerful 
aid to build future capability. 
Each module component from dashboards and scorecards to alerts to anonymised 
metrics ensures that municipalities remain focused on delivery, not bureaucracy.  
Dashboard Examples: Service Delivery 
Traffic Light Management 
Road Condition – Pothole Management 
 
 
It enables DDM and National Treasury oversight without micromanagement, 
accountability without blame, and transparency without fear. 
Dashboard Examples: Finance and Human Resources 
Financial Dashboard 
HR KPI’s 
 
 
These dashboards and scorecards enable easy monitoring and can be viewed at a 
national level with the drilldown to local municipality levels allowing for the identification 
of risk areas and municipalities, and where national government needs to ensure budget 
allocation for larger reforming and modernising projects such as smart metering 
solutions.

Methodology 
MacrocommAI is not just about being a use-case scenario solution rather we focus on 
Industrialised Intelligence that is grounded in an AI Centre of Excellence that is grounded 
in an intentional, government-wide operating model that focuses on the development of 
a strategic centre which is aligned to all constitutional obligations and local government 
objectives.  This strategic centre is based upon three core pillars: technical capability for 
resilience and scalability, value fulfilment engine, and a robust risk and compliance 
structure. 
5.1 Design the DDM AI Target Operating Model 
To have a robust Target Operating Model (TOM), the following would need to be 
established: a data science team to work closely with CoGTA, National Treasury, DDM, 
SALGA and Local Government (as rolled out to each district or metropolitan area); a 
Centre of Excellence at DDM, and an AI Governance Council with senior stakeholders 
across government entities. 
5.2 An AI Capabilities Assessment and Map 
MacrocommAI will aid CoGTA, National Treasury, DDM, Provincial and Local Government 
to assess and align their capabilities.   
•No more quarterly reports. Live 
dashboards make service delivery 
transparent.
Real-Time Visibility
•Alerts before systems collapse allow for 
preventative action.
Early Intervention
•Everyone works toward the same 
measurable objectives.
Unified Accountability
•A single model applied across 
municipalities for benchmarking.
National 
Standardisation
•Residents see tangible, trackable proof 
of delivery.
Public Trust

5.3 Change Management and Communication Strategy 
MacrocommAI will create clear, consistent and pertinent communication strategies to 
ensure that all stakeholders are informed of the benefits and impact of this solution. 
5.4 AI Target Operating Model: Centralised Hybrid TOM 
To facilitate and enable the DDM for CoGTA and National Treasury, an AI Centralised TOM 
is proposed with a hybrid of local government aligned hubs. 
5.4.1 
Centralised TOM 
The starting point would be to build the Centralised TOM strength to ensure governance 
oversight through a Centre of Excellence and a Portfolio Steering Committee that 
oversees the Planning (where all government priorities, objectives and KPI are set and 
managed), Building (solution development and project management) and Deployment 
(Where the solutions are implemented and maintained).  
5.4.1.1 Benefits 
The benefits are effective long-term planning, strong oversight of finances and 
governance, best practice and centralised technology solutions, economies of scale, 
expertise development across government and cost effectiveness.   
5.4.1.2 Downside 
The downside to be managed are the potential silos that may occur between the teams 
that plan, build and deploy, agility may be comprised, a one-size-fits-all approach across 
all local government and slower decision making due to steering portfolio protocols. 
5.4.2 
Hybrid Local Government (Geographically) Aligned TOM 
The second phase would be to add a sub-layer of local government aligned hubs where 
there is a local government portfolio steering committee that provides the required 
oversight and strategy to meet the needs, objectives and targets of that district or 
metropolitan area. 
5.4.2.1 Benefits 
The benefit of building this hybrid alignment will be autonomy and agility regarding the 
local government requirements and allow for dedicated local teams to ensure that all 
service demands are met.   
5.4.2.2 Downside 
The downside is that this level of AI capability and maturity will need to be developed with 
the required supporting processes, technology standards, demands collaboration and 
strong communication to prevent loss of synergy and unnecessary complexity.   
This will require upskilling and cross-learning across each area, continual reinforcement 
of the bigger DDM AI Governance strategy, regular enforcement of standards to remove 

 
 
 
 
MG-PPSL-AISMUNIC-COGTA 202508.03 MG SMART MUNICIPALITY PROPOSAL TO COGTA 
Page 14 | 15 
 
siloed technology architecture and awareness that initially it will be costly but if well 
managed become cost effective and show returns.  
5.4.3 
Implementation Approach Proposed 
Build the centralised operating model and parallel run the development of hybrid aligned 
(geographical) operation model with those local governments (municipalities) that are 
identified as being the most digitally inclined to adopt the Smart Municipality solution.   
SALGA has identified Cape Town, Johannesburg, Tshwane, and eThekwini, as well as other 
districts and municipalities such as Dr Kenneth Kaunda, Gert Sibande, O.R. Tambo, Pixley 
ka Seme, Thabo Mofutsanyane, Umgungundlovu, Umzinyathi, and Vhembe as being 
digitally inclined municipalities. 
6 
Timeline From Design to Implement 
The timeline from Design to Implementation is assessed in a pre-audit assessment for 
final solutioning and project plan design.   
The timeline will be broken into three core phases of deliverables for review of 90, 180 
and 270 days.
