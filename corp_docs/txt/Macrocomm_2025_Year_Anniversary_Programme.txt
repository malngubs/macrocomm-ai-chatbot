Start Time: 18:00 
Activity Overview 


Participants will have the freedom to form their own teams of 6–7 members. Each 
team must prepare a traditional Potjiekos using one of three chosen meats: 
- Venison 
- Chicken 
- Seafood 
To add creativity and a personal touch, participants are encouraged to bring their 
own spices. Salads and starch accompaniments will be prepared by the hotel, 
ensuring the spotlight remains on the Potjie itself. 
Teambuilding Twist 
A dedicated teambuilding facilitator will guide the event, introducing surprise tasks 
and curveballs that must be completed during the cooking process. These 
challenges will test each team’s ability to stay calm under pressure, adapt quickly, 
and continue working together towards a shared goal — just like in business. Judges 
will evaluate not only taste and creativity, but also teamwork, innovation, and 
presentation.
