Dear Team, 
 
As part of our commitment to environmental sustainability, all employees are required to 
complete the introduction to ISO 14001/Environmental Management Systems (EMS) 
training by 14th March 2025. 
 
This training will provide an understanding of the importance of EMS and how we can 
reduce our environmental impact, improve operational efficiency, and comply with 
regulations. It focuses on areas such as pollution prevention, energy conservation, and 
waste reduction, key to achieving both legal compliance and business goals. 
 
Key benefits of implementing EMS include: 
• Reducing environmental impact and managing emissions, waste, and hazardous 
materials. 
• Improving energy efficiency and reducing operational costs. 
• Contributing to sustainable business practices and enhancing stakeholder 
relationships. 
 
Macrocomm Group has incorporated the EMS into the Health and Safety Environment 
Plans, Policies, and Procedures. All employees play an important role in supporting this 
system and ensuring our ongoing compliance.
