DISCIPLINARY CODE 
1 
Purpose 
The purpose of this code is to outline the standard of conduct   and   rules   applicable   
to   employees   at   the workplace. It is accepted that a disciplinary code and procedure 
is necessary for the efficient running of the Company, the safety and fair treatment of 
all employees and for ensuring sound labour/management relations. 
Furthermore it provides guidelines for managers to ensure the   fair,   just   and   
uniform   application   of   disciplinary measures   and   to   provide   a   reference for   
managers engaged in applying discipline. The sanctions as stated in this policy can be 
relaxed or made more severe due to the specific circumstances and merits of each 
case. The charges as mentioned in this policy are guidelines to possible offenses and 
are in no way exhaustive and limited in its application. 
1.1 Scope 
All Staff Members 
1.2 Responsibility and Authority 
Management will apply and enforce this code in order to ensure a harmonious 
working environment characterised by discipline and consistency. Furthermore, it will 
be a joint effort between management and employees to ensure that all employees are 
aware of the   company’s   disciplinary   code.   The   code   will   be accessible through 
hard copies. 
1.3 UNDERLYING PRINCIPLES 
This code is based on the following principles, which must be observed under all 
circumstances:

1.3.1 The application of discipline is the right and responsibility of supervisors and 
managers. As disciplinary action should not be taken lightly, the responsibility for 
implementing action is reserved for company representatives of the appropriate 
responsibility and seniority. The imposition of discipline is therefore the 
prerogative of management only. 
1.3.2 Disciplinary steps are instituted in order to obtain the co-operation and 
involvement of all employees within the workplace, and to protect the interests of 
both the employee and the Practice in the process of dealing with unacceptable 
behaviour. 
1.3.3 In the enforcement of discipline, the emphasis must rather be focused on guidance 
and rehabilitation than on the imposition of punishment. In other words, discipline 
must be corrective rather than punitive. However, where necessary, punishment 
must be used as a legitimate deterrent in the maintenance of discipline. 
1.3.4 In certain instances the company reserves the right to impose the most severe 
sanction on an employee without having to follow the principle of corrective and 
progressive discipline. 
1.3.5 The application of discipline must at all times be lawful, just, fair and consistent. 
When an employee is suspected of committing serious misconduct (e.g. theft, 
fraud, etc.), prior to an investigation being initiated, the relevant HR Consultant 
should be notified. This will allow for a decision to be taken on whether the 
suspected employee should be suspended during the investigation process. On 
completion of the investigation, the findings should be submitted to the Internal 
Industrial Relations Specialist who will then advise on the way forward. Should 
there be a need to interview the suspected employee, an HR representative should 
be present during this interview; the employee will also have the right to have his 
representative present if he/she so wishes. This will allow for transparency and in 
keeping in line with the principles of this policy.

DISCIPLINARY CODE AND PROCEDURE 
2.1 DISCIPLINARY SANCTIONS 
There are four (4) basic sanctions that can be imposed against any employee. In order 
of severity, they are: 
2.1.1 Counselling 
For certain offences, which are deemed to be light or do not warrant a 
disciplinary inquiry, a counselling session will be held. This session is aimed at 
trying to correct the employee’s unacceptable behaviour. This session will be 
attended by the Head of Department, the employee and the Human Resources

Consultant (where geographically viable). Where it is not geographically viable, 
for the HR Consultant to attend the counselling session, they will still be required 
to provide advice and support to the HOD to ensure that the counselling process 
is properly implemented. The standard Counselling form must be used (see 
addendum 1). Counselling session outcomes will be recorded and kept in the 
employee’s file. 
2.1.2 Verbal warning 
 In a case of a moderate offence, a manager and their allocated HR Consultant 
should conduct an informal disciplinary interview with the employee that may 
result in a verbal reprimand. 
*Written record is kept of this warning and it will be valid for three (3) months. 
Managers are required to forward signed copies of all verbal warnings to their 
allocated HR Consultant for filing. Please contact your HR Consultant to schedule 
the disciplinary interview. Note that no formal disciplinary inquiry is required 
to issue a verbal warning. 
2.1.3 Written warning and final written warning 
 If verbal reprimands do not yield the desired result, in other words if the 
employee persists with the unacceptable behaviour, then the matter may be 
escalated to a formal disciplinary inquiry. The Chairperson of the inquiry will 
recommend the appropriate sanction based on, but not limited to, the severity of 
the offence, mitigating and aggravating factors. 
 A written warning will be valid for a period of six (6) months and a final written 
warning twelve (12) months. No written and final warnings can be issued without 
a formal disciplinary enquiry been held. All written warnings will be recorded on 
a disciplinary form that will be placed on the employee’s file. A copy of the 
disciplinary form will be handed to the employee. 
* Refer to Section 2: Formal Disciplinary Inquiry Procedure for further details 
2.1.4 Dismissal with pay in lieu of notice or summary dismissals. 
 If an employee commits a serious offence or a series of attempts to correct the 
employee’s behaviour have not been successful, a disciplinary inquiry will be 
convened before a decision to terminate employment is taken. In certain 
instances, dismissal without notice pay will be justified depending on the nature 
and severity of the offence. 
 * Refer to Section 2: Formal Disciplinary Inquiry Procedure for further detail

FORMAL DISCIPLINARY INQUIRY PROCEDURE 
It is not required that for every offence a formal disciplinary inquiry be convened prior 
to deciding on appropriate action. In cases of minor offences an informal inquiry can be 
conducted prior to imposing a disciplinary sanction. (COUNSELLINGS AND VERBAL 
WARNINGS) 
However, in the event that a severe offence has been committed or there exists the 
possibility that should the employee concerned be found guilty, he/she could face 
severe sanction up to and including a final written warning or dismissal, a disciplinary 
inquiry should be convened. The HOD should log a request for a disciplinary hearing in 
writing as soon as he/she becomes aware of the misconduct. Only in exceptional 
circumstances (for example where the employee was ill and hospitalised, the alleged 
misconduct is of a complex nature involving lengthy investigations, should the HOD 
log the request for the disciplinary hearing at a later stage but in any event, the 
disciplinary hearing should be convened within a period of not more than three 
months. 
(Addendum 2 details the information required when logging the incident via e-mail) 
In the event that a disciplinary inquiry is convened the following principles should be 
observed: 
• The inquiry should be held as soon as possible after the event, provided that a 
reasonable time is accorded to the employee to prepare for his defence. 
Employees required to attend a disciplinary hearing, will be allowed a 
minimum of 48 hours between receiving the charge sheet to the date of the 
inquiry to enable the employee to prepare for the inquiry. 
• The employee may, if necessary, be suspended with pay. Suspension must 
be considered if there is a possibility that the accused employee might 
interfere with the investigation, damage company property, intimidate other 
employees who may be witnesses at the disciplinary inquiry or for any other 
reason that may jeopardise the investigation into the alleged misconduct. 
Before suspending an employee the employee must be given the right to 
address the company on any grounds why he should not be suspended. 
• The employee should, within a reasonable time after committing the alleged 
offence, be notified in writing of the date, time and venue of the inquiry; 
• The employee must be informed in writing of the misconduct, which he/she is 
alleged to have committed and his/her rights at the inquiry. 
• The written  notification  of  the  alleged  offences  committed  by  the  
employee  should  have sufficient information for the employee to prepare a 
defence to the charges. 
NO EMPLOYEE SHOULD BE DISMISSED WITHOUT A 
DISCIPLINARY INQUIRY BEING CONDUCTED

ABSCONTION PROCESS 
In terms of clause 1.8.1.1 an unauthorised absence from work of five days or more 
constitutes abscontion which is a misconduct matter. The procedure to be followed 
when dealing with abscontion is as follows: 
• A notice of abscontion together with the notice of abscontion hearing will be 
prepared and sent to the staff member. The company will use the Courier 
services when sending the notice of abscontion and the notice of abscontion 
hearing to the employee. The employee will be required to respond to the 
notice of abscontion within two working days of receiving the same. 
Furthermore, the employee will be provided with a period of four working days 
in order to prepare for the abscontion hearing.
