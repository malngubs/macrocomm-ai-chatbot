DISCIPLINARY CODE

1 Purpose

The purpose of this code is to outline the standard of conduct and rules applicable
to employees at the workplace. It is accepted that a disciplinary code and procedure
is necessary for the efficient running of the Company, the safety and fair treatment of
all employees and for ensuring sound labour/management relations.

Furthermore it provides guidelines for managers to ensure the fair, just and
uniform application of disciplinary measures and to provide a_ reference for
managers engaged in applying discipline. The sanctions as stated in this policy can be
relaxed or made more severe due to the specific circumstances and merits of each
case. The charges as mentioned in this policy are guidelines to possible offenses and
are in no way exhaustive and limited in its application.

1.1 Scope

All Staff Members
1.2 Responsibility and Authority

Management will apply and enforce this code in order to ensure a harmonious
working environment characterised by discipline and consistency. Furthermore, it will
be a joint effort between management and employees to ensure that all employees are
aware of the company's disciplinary code. The code will be accessible through
hard copies.

1.3. UNDERLYING PRINCIPLES

This code is based on the following principles, which must be observed under all
circumstances:

1.3.1. The application of discipline is the right and responsibility of supervisors and

1.3.2

1.3.3

1.3.4

1.3.5

managers. As disciplinary action should not be taken lightly, the responsibility for
implementing action is reserved for company representatives of the appropriate
responsibility and seniority. The imposition of discipline is therefore the
prerogative of management only.

Disciplinary steps are instituted in order to obtain the co-operation and
involvement of all employees within the workplace, and to protect the interests of
both the employee and the Practice in the process of dealing with unacceptable
behaviour.

In the enforcement of discipline, the emphasis must rather be focused on guidance
and rehabilitation than on the imposition of punishment. In other words, discipline
must be corrective rather than punitive. However, where necessary, punishment
must be used as a legitimate deterrent in the maintenance of discipline.

In certain instances the company reserves the right to impose the most severe
sanction on an employee without having to follow the principle of corrective and
progressive discipline.

The application of discipline must at all times be lawful, just, fair and consistent.
When an employee is suspected of committing serious misconduct (e.g. theft,
fraud, etc.), prior to an investigation being initiated, the relevant HR Consultant
should be notified. This will allow for a decision to be taken on whether the
suspected employee should be suspended during the investigation process. On
completion of the investigation, the findings should be submitted to the Internal
Industrial Relations Specialist who will then advise on the way forward. Should
there be a need to interview the suspected employee, an HR representative should
be present during this interview; the employee will also have the right to have his
representative present if he/she so wishes. This will allow for transparency and in
keeping in line with the principles of this policy.

2 DISCIPLINARY CODE AND PROCEDURE

2.1 DISCIPLINARY SANCTIONS

There are four (4) basic sanctions that can be imposed against any employee. In order
of severity, they are:

2.1.1

Counselling

For certain offences, which are deemed to be light or do not warrant a
disciplinary inquiry, a counselling session will be held. This session is aimed at
trying to correct the employee’s unacceptable behaviour. This session will be
attended by the Head of Department, the employee and the Human Resources

Date of Next Revision 12 JUNE 2026

Consultant (where geographically viable). Where it is not geographically viable,
for the HR Consultant to attend the counselling session, they will still be required
to provide advice and support to the HOD to ensure that the counselling process
is properly implemented. The standard Counselling form must be used (see
addendum 1). Counselling session outcomes will be recorded and kept in the
employee's file.

2.1.2 Verbal warning

In a case of a moderate offence, a manager and their allocated HR Consultant
should conduct an informal disciplinary interview with the employee that may
result in a verbal reprimand.

*Written record is kept of this warning and it will be valid for three (3) months.
Managers are required to forward signed copies of all verbal warnings to their
allocated HR Consultant for filing. Please contact your HR Consultant to schedule
the disciplinary interview. Note that no formal disciplinary inquiry is required
to issue a verbal warning.

2.1.3. Written warning and final written warning

If verbal reprimands do not yield the desired result, in other words if the
employee persists with the unacceptable behaviour, then the matter may be
escalated to a formal disciplinary inquiry. The Chairperson of the inquiry will
recommend the appropriate sanction based on, but not limited to, the severity of
the offence, mitigating and aggravating factors.

A written warning will be valid for a period of six (6) months and a final written
warning twelve (12) months. No written and final warnings can be issued without
a formal disciplinary enquiry been held. All written warnings will be recorded on
a disciplinary form that will be placed on the employee's file. A copy of the
disciplinary form will be handed to the employee.

* Refer to Section 2: Formal Disciplinary Inquiry Procedure for further details

2.1.4 Dismissal with pay in lieu of notice or summary dismissals.

If an employee commits a serious offence or a series of attempts to correct the
employee's behaviour have not been successful, a disciplinary inquiry will be
convened before a decision to terminate employment is taken. In certain
instances, dismissal without notice pay will be justified depending on the nature
and severity of the offence.

* Refer to Section 2: Formal Disciplinary Inquiry Procedure for further detail

3 FORMAL DISCIPLINARY INQUIRY PROCEDURE

It is not required that for every offence a formal disciplinary inquiry be convened prior
to deciding on appropriate action. In cases of minor offences an informal inquiry can be
conducted prior to imposing a disciplinary sanction. (COUNSELLINGS AND VERBAL
WARNINGS)

However, in the event that a severe offence has been committed or there exists the
possibility that should the employee concerned be found guilty, he/she could face
severe sanction up to and including a final written warning or dismissal, a disciplinary
inquiry should be convened. The HOD should log a request for a disciplinary hearing in
writing as soon as he/she becomes aware of the misconduct. Only in exceptional
circumstances (for example where the employee was ill and hospitalised, the alleged
misconduct is of a complex nature involving lengthy investigations, should the HOD
log the request for the disciplinary hearing at a later stage but in any event, the
disciplinary hearing should be convened within a period of not more than three
months.

(Addendum 2 details the information required when logging the incident via e-mail)

In the event that a disciplinary inquiry is convened the following principles should be
observed:

e The inquiry should be held as soon as possible after the event, provided that a
reasonable time is accorded to the employee to prepare for his defence.
Employees required to attend a disciplinary hearing, will be allowed a
minimum of 48 hours between receiving the charge sheet to the date of the
inquiry to enable the employee to prepare for the inquiry.

e The employee may, if necessary, be suspended with pay. Suspension must
be considered if there is a possibility that the accused employee might
interfere with the investigation, damage company property, intimidate other
employees who may be witnesses at the disciplinary inquiry or for any other
reason that may jeopardise the investigation into the alleged misconduct.
Before suspending an employee the employee must be given the right to
address the company on any grounds why he should not be suspended.

e The employee should, within a reasonable time after committing the alleged
offence, be notified in writing of the date, time and venue of the inquiry;

e The employee must be informed in writing of the misconduct, which he/she is
alleged to have committed and his/her rights at the inquiry.

e Thewritten notification of the alleged offences committed by the

employee should have sufficient information for the employee to prepare a
defence to the charges.

NO EMPLOYEE SHOULD BE DISMISSED WITHOUT A
DISCIPLINARY INQUIRY BEING CONDUCTED
