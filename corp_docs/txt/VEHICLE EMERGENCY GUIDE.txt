A JUMP?

When you turn the key...

If it cranks slowly or
not at all, you
probably have a
dead battery.

(If it cranks quickly,
you probably don't
have a dead battery)
If your headlights are
dim, you probably
have a dead battery.
(If they are bright,
your battery is
probably okay)

If your dash lights
light up and then go
dark or dim when
you crank it, you

probably have a dead
battery.

completely (Optional,

14) Replace The Hubcap

1. Find A Safe

Location
DO NOT abruptly
brake or turn.
Slowly reduce speed
and find a stretch
that is:

e Level - prevents your
vehicle from rolling

e Straight - better than
curves because
oncoming traffic is
more likely to see
you

e Wide shoulder - an
empty parking lot
would be an ideal
place.

***Driving on a flat tyre

risk ruining your rim, so

try to find a good spot

quickly.

2. Turn On Your
Hazard Lights

3. Apply The
Parking Brake

4. Apply Wheel

Wedges
Wheel wedges (or bricks
or large stones - just be

Page 7 of 40

sure they're large
enough) go in front of or
behind the tyres to
ensure the vehicle
doesn't roll while you fix
the flat tyre.

If you're changing a
rear tyre, place these
in front of the front
tyres.

lf your flat tyre is at
the front, put the
wheel wedges behind
the rear tyres
Remove The
Hubcap or
Wheel Cover

If your vehicle has a
hubcap covering the
lug nuts, it’s easier to
remove the hubcap
before lifting the
vehicle with the jack.
If you don't have a
hubcap or wheel
cover, you can skip
this step.

Use the flat end of
your lug wrench to
remove the hubcap.
This works for most
vehicles, but some

hubcaps need a
different tool to
remove them.
Loosen The Lug
Nuts

Using the lug wrench,
turn the lug nuts
counterclockwise
(you can use your
foot or all your body
weight if necessary).
Loosen the lug nuts
about % of a turn, but
don’t remove them
completely yet.

. Place The Jack

Under The
Vehicle

The

correct oN

place for a
the jack is ,
usually Lo}
beneath

the vehicle frame
alongside the tyre
that’s flat. Many
vehicle frames have
molded plastic on

the bottom with a
cleared area of

Page 8 of 40

exposed metal
specifically for the
jack. To safely lift and
avoid damage to the
vehicle, follow the
instructions for jack
placement in your
vehicle owner's
manual.

Raise The
Vehicle With The
Jack

Raise the vehicle until
the flat tyre is about
6inches 4.

above the
ground (this is to
allow enough room
for a fully pumped-up
spare tyre to go on).
Never put any part of
your body under the
vehicle during or
after raising the
vehicle.

Unscrew The Lug
Nuts

Since you've already
loosened them, you
should be able to
unscrew them mostly by
hand.

10.Remove The Flat

11.

Tyre

Gripping the tyre by
the treads, pull it
gently toward you
until it’s completely
free.

Set it on its side, so it
doesn't roll away.

Mount The
Spare Tyre On
The Lug Bolts
Line up the rim with
the lug bolts and
push gently until the
lug
bolts

show qi .
through
the rim.

12. Tighten The Lug
Nuts By Hand

Put the lug nuts back
on the lug bolts and
tighten them all the
way by hand.

Once they are all on,
check each once
again, tightening as
much as possible.

Page 9 of 40

e You will tighten them
with the wrench after
lowering the vehicle
to the ground.

13. Lower Vehicle
and Tighten Lug

Nuts Again

e Use the jack to lower
the vehicle so that
the spare tyre is
resting on the
ground, but the full
weight of the vehicle
isn’t fully on the tyre.

e Tighten the lug nuts
with the wrench,
turning clockwise,
pushing down on the
lug wrench with the
full weight of your
body.

e Order of lug nuts to
be tightened: Tighten
lug nuts in a star
pattern if 5 lug nuts,
or move diagonally,
across, and then
diagonally again if 4
lug nuts.

14. Lower The

Vehicle Completely

e Bring the vehicle all
the way to the
ground and remove
the jack.

e Give the lug nuts
another pulls with
the wrench to ensure
they're as tight as
possible.

15. Replace The

Hubcap (Optional)

e Ifthe hubcap you
took from the flat
tyre will fit your
Spare, put it in place
the same way you
removed it initially.

e §=Ifit doesn't fit, stow it
away with the tyre
when you stow your
equipment.

16. Stow All

Equipment

Don't forget to load

everything back into your

vehicle before driving
away.

17. Check The
Pressure in the
Spare Tyre

“T-Type” temporary
spares, also called
“mini-spares,” could
require 60 PSI.

If the tyre needs
pressure, drive
(slowly) to a service
station immediately.
Temporary spare
tyres aren't made to
drive long distances
or at high speeds, so
drive cautiously until
you're able to visit a
tyre technician.
