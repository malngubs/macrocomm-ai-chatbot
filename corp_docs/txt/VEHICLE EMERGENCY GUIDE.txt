how to 
JUMP
A CAR 
DO YOU NEED 
A JUMP? 
When you turn the key.... 
• 
If it cranks slowly or 
not at all, you 
probably have a 
dead battery.  
(If it cranks quickly, 
you probably don’t 
have a dead battery) 
• 
If your headlights are 
dim, you probably 
have a dead battery.  
• 
(If they are bright, 
your battery is 
probably okay) 
• 
If your dash lights 
light up and then go 
dark or dim when 
you crank it, you  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
probably have a dead 
battery. 
 
 
 
      WARNING: These 
instructions are not 
intended to replace 
professional advice; they 
simply provide a summary.

HOW TO JUMP A 
CAR 
1. Get a running car 
Park the running car near, but 
not touching the disabled car, 
trying to position the car in a way 
to minimize the distance 
between the batteries. 
• 
Prepare both cars 
• 
Make sure both engines are 
off. 
• 
Pop the hood on both 
vehicles. 
• 
Locate the battery on each 
vehicle. 
 
2. Get out your jumper 
cables 
The positive (+) terminal will 
usually have a red cable, and 
the negative (-) terminal will 
usually have a black cable.  
ONCE CONNECTED TO A 
BATTERY, 
MAKE SURE 
THE RED AND 
BLACK ENDS 
OF THE 
JUMPER 
CABLES 
DON’T 
TOUCH! 
MAKE SURE NONE 
OF THE CABLES ARE 
DANGLING INTO 
ENGINE COMPARTMENT. 

 
Page 5 of 40 
3. Connect the jumper 
cables 
• 
Connect one RED CLAMP 
to the POSITIVE (+) 
terminal of the dead 
battery. 
• 
Connect the other RED 
CLAMP to the POSITIVE 
(+) terminal of the good 
battery. 
 
• 
Connect one BLACK 
CLAMP to NEGATIVE (-) 
terminal of the good 
battery. 
• 
Connect the other BLACK 
CLAMP to a piece of 
grounded metal on the 
dead car or connect it to 
the NEGATIVE (-) post of 
the dead battery. 
4. Start the working 
car 
• 
Let idle for a few 
minutes. 
• 
Rev the engine a little 
above idle for 30-60 
seconds 
5. Try to start the 
dead car 
• 
If it doesn’t start, shut 
the engine of the 
working car off before 
checking the 
connections. 
• 
Restart the working car 
and let it idle for another 
5 minutes before 
attempting to start the 
disabled car. If this 
doesn’t work after a few 
tries, you may need to 
have the car towed. 
6. Remove jumper 
cables once car 
starts 
• 
Do this in the REVERSE 
order in which they were 
attached. 
DON’T LET 
CABLES OR CLAMPS 
TOUCH EACH OTHER 
OR THE ENGINE. 

 
Page 6 of 40 
• 
Remove BLACK (-) from 
dead car. 
• 
Disconnect BLACK (-) 
from good car. 
• 
Disconnect RED (+) from 
good battery. Disconnect 
RED (+) from dead 
battery. Replace any post 
covers if applicable. 
7. Keep your car running 
• 
Run car above idle (slightly 
revved with foot gently on 
gas) for 5 minutes, then on 
or above idle for 20 min 
before turning off.

how to 
CHANGE 
A TYRE 
Changing a flat tyre 
should only take you 15-
30 minutes ... you got 
this! 
1.   Find A Safe 
Location 
• 
DO NOT abruptly 
brake or turn. 
• 
Slowly reduce speed 
and find a stretch 
that is: 
• 
Level - prevents your 
vehicle from rolling 
• 
Straight - better than 
curves because 
oncoming traffic is 
more likely to see 
you 
• 
Wide shoulder - an 
empty parking lot 
would be an ideal 
place. 
***Driving on a flat tyre 
risk ruining your rim, so 
try to find a good spot 
quickly. 
2. Turn On Your 
Hazard Lights 
3. Apply The 
Parking Brake 
4. Apply Wheel 
Wedges 
Wheel wedges (or bricks 
or large stones - just be 

 
Page 8 of 40 
sure they’re large 
enough) go in front of or 
behind the tyres to 
ensure the vehicle 
doesn’t roll while you fix 
the flat tyre. 
• 
If you’re changing a 
rear tyre, place these 
in front of the front 
tyres. 
• 
If your flat tyre is at 
the front, put the 
wheel wedges behind 
the rear tyres 
5. Remove The 
Hubcap or 
Wheel Cover 
• 
If your vehicle has a 
hubcap covering the 
lug nuts, it’s easier to 
remove the hubcap 
before lifting the 
vehicle with the jack. 
• 
If you don’t have a 
hubcap or wheel 
cover, you can skip 
this step. 
• 
Use the flat end of 
your lug wrench to 
remove the hubcap. 
• 
This works for most 
vehicles, but some 
hubcaps need a 
different tool to 
remove them. 
6. Loosen The Lug 
Nuts 
• 
Using the lug wrench, 
turn the lug nuts 
counterclockwise 
(you can use your 
foot or all your body 
weight if necessary). 
• 
Loosen the lug nuts 
about ½ of a turn, but 
don’t remove them 
completely yet. 
7. Place The Jack 
Under The 
Vehicle 
• 
The 
correct 
place for 
the jack is 
usually 
beneath 
the vehicle frame 
alongside the tyre 
that’s flat. Many 
vehicle frames have 
molded plastic on 
the bottom with a 
cleared area of 

 
Page 9 of 40 
exposed metal 
specifically for the 
jack. To safely lift and 
avoid damage to the 
vehicle, follow the 
instructions for jack 
placement in your 
vehicle owner’s 
manual. 
8. Raise The 
Vehicle With The 
Jack 
• 
Raise the vehicle until 
the flat tyre is about 
6 inches 
above 
the 
ground (this is to 
allow enough room 
for a fully pumped-up 
spare tyre to go on). 
• 
Never put any part of 
your body under the 
vehicle during or 
after raising the 
vehicle. 
9. Unscrew The Lug 
Nuts 
Since you've already 
loosened them, you 
should be able to 
unscrew them mostly by 
hand. 
10. Remove The Flat 
Tyre 
• 
Gripping the tyre by 
the treads, pull it 
gently toward you 
until it’s completely 
free. 
• 
Set it on its side, so it 
doesn’t roll away. 
11. Mount The 
Spare Tyre On 
The Lug Bolts 
• 
Line up the rim with 
the lug bolts and 
push gently until the 
lug 
bolts 
show 
through 
the rim. 
12. Tighten The Lug 
Nuts By Hand 
• 
Put the lug nuts back 
on the lug bolts and 
tighten them all the 
way by hand.  
• 
Once they are all on, 
check each once 
again, tightening as 
much as possible.  

 
Page 10 of 40 
• 
You will tighten them 
with the wrench after 
lowering the vehicle 
to the ground. 
13. Lower Vehicle 
and Tighten Lug 
Nuts Again 
• 
Use the jack to lower 
the vehicle so that 
the spare tyre is 
resting on the 
ground, but the full 
weight of the vehicle 
isn’t fully on the tyre.  
• 
Tighten the lug nuts 
with the wrench, 
turning clockwise, 
pushing down on the 
lug wrench with the 
full weight of your 
body. 
• 
Order of lug nuts to 
be tightened: Tighten 
lug nuts in a star 
pattern if 5 lug nuts, 
or move diagonally, 
across, and then 
diagonally again if 4 
lug nuts. 
14. Lower The 
Vehicle Completely 
• 
Bring the vehicle all 
the way to the 
ground and remove 
the jack.  
• 
Give the lug nuts 
another pulls with 
the wrench to ensure 
they’re as tight as 
possible. 
15. Replace The 
Hubcap (Optional) 
• 
If the hubcap you 
took from the flat 
tyre will fit your 
spare, put it in place 
the same way you 
removed it initially.  
• 
If it doesn’t fit, stow it 
away with the tyre 
when you stow your 
equipment. 
16. Stow All 
Equipment 
Don’t forget to load 
everything back into your 
vehicle before driving 
away. 
• 
Jack 
• 
Lug wrench 

 
Page 11 of 40 
• 
Wheel wedges 
(possibly) 
• 
Flat tyre 
• 
Hubcap (possibly) 
• 
Flashlight (possibly) 
17. Check The 
Pressure in the 
Spare Tyre 
• 
“T-Type” temporary 
spares, also called 
“mini-spares,” could 
require 60 PSI.  
• 
If the tyre needs 
pressure, drive 
(slowly) to a service 
station immediately. 
Temporary spare 
tyres aren’t made to 
drive long distances 
or at high speeds, so 
drive cautiously until 
you’re able to visit a 
tyre technician.
