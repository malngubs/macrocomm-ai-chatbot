Macrocomm Scholar Transport - Limpopo Department of Education
Executive Summary

Safe and reliable scholar transport is a critical enabler of education in South Africa, where
thousands of learners depend on buses, taxis, and contracted vehicles to access schools
daily. Parents and the Department of Education must trust that learners are transported
securely, affordably, and reliably.

Drivers, funded partly through scholar transport grants, carry a dual responsibility;
ensuring the safety of children and maintaining compliance with licensing, health, and
service standards.

Macrocomm has developed a Smart Scholar Transport Ecosystem, combining Al-powered
cameras, telematics devices, alcohol ignition interlock technology, and fleet analytics to
provide:
e Peace of mind for parents and schools by monitoring safety, incidents, and scholar
attendance.
e Compliance and efficiency for the Department by ensuring grant-funded trips are
validated and drivers are compliant.
e Operational support for drivers by offering reports, behavioural feedback, and
cost-saving measures that protect their livelinood.

Addressing the Key Pain Points

This solution is purpose-built to ensure safe, reliable, and transparent learner transport
in Limpopo, while also addressing fraud prevention and funding accountability.

The system integrates vehicle safety, driver accountability, learner verification, and real-
time reporting to safeguard lives and reduce costs.

The Department faces challenges as they cannot always verify if a grant-funded trip was
delivered. Additionally, scholar transport owners may not know if the licensed shift driver
is the one behind the wheel, if the vehicle is overloaded, or if the driver is fatigued or
inebriated. Parents themselves lack visibility into whether their children arrived safely
and on time at school or home, and drivers may struggle with compliance costs despite
receiving grants.

This leaves the Department in a situation that results in the following financial loss and
safety risks:

SMART MADE SIMPLE

Cause of Financial and Safety Risks
Description

Many scholar transport vehicles are poorly maintained, lack valid
permits, or are unroadworthy, putting learners at risk.

Inadequate vetting and monitoring allow unqualified or fatigued
drivers to operate learner transport.

Trip logs, attendance registers, and maintenance schedules are kept
manually, creating opportunities for error and fraud.

Operators may claim subsidies for learners or trips that never took
place.

Learners changing schools or dropping out are not always updated in
transport records, leading to funding misallocation.

The Need for Better Accountability

South Africa’s scholar transport funding falls under the Learner Transport Programme,
managed jointly by the Department of Basic Education (DBE) and the Department of
Transport (DOT). Provinces contract service providers and allocate funds per learner

transported.

Provincial Oversight & Reporting

Our Al-powered transport verification system enables the Limpopo Department of
Education and Transport to:

e Track fleet safety in real time: Vehicles, drivers, and learners monitored on one
platform.

e Analyse TCO across the fleet: Compare operators, identify cost inefficiencies,
reduce subsidy waste.

e Targeted safety interventions: Spot recurring issues like unroadworthy vehicles or
high-risk drivers.

e Transparency & trust: Parents, schools, and communities see scholar transport as
reliable and accountable.

Proposed Solution - Solution Overview

Our blended solution of telematics, Al camera systems and Alcohol Ignition Interlock
provides an effective means of monitoring and controlling the two key pillars of scholar
transport: safety and management.

These capabilities ensure the system is accurate, secure, scalable, and usable in diverse
school environments from rural no-fee schools to larger urban campuses with minimal
disruption.

Implementation & Technological Considerations

As learner transport operators explore technology to improve safety, efficiency, and
accountability, the selection of vehicle-based tools is critical particularly where budgets
and infrastructure are constrained. Fixed monitoring solutions limited to depot-based
systems often fail to address real-world challenges such as driver behaviour, route
compliance, passenger safety, and vehicle health in motion.

By contrast, an integrated in-vehicle hardware ecosystem provides a scalable and
practical approach. Using a combination of future ready technologies such as telematics
devices, backup communications, Al-driven cameras, passenger counting systems, and
alcohol interlocks, operators gain real-time insights into both driver conduct and vehicle
performance, while ensuring compliance with safety regulations and funding models.

The table below illustrates the core challenges with traditional monitoring versus the
advantages of our integrated vehicle-based system:

Challenge with Traditional / Advantages of Vehicle-Embedded Hardware
Depot-Based Systems

Limited visibility once the Continuous live monitoring via GPS tracking and geo-
vehicle leaves the depot zones

High comms risk if 4G/primary — Sigfox loT backup device ensures failover connectivity
network fails

Passenger verification often Al passenger counting cameras with real-time alerts on
manual or inaccurate overload

Unsafe driving behaviour only Al in-cab + forward-facing cameras detect fatigue,
reported after incidents distraction, smoking, and non-seatbelt use in real time

No control over driver sobriety = Alcohol ignition interlock prevents vehicle start if
alcohol is detected

Maintenance often reactive, Automated service interval alerts + telematics reports
raising TCO optimise maintenance scheduling

Legal, Ethical, and Practical Considerations

Our solution is designed with learner safety, driver accountability, and data protection as
the foundation.

Safeguard Details
Compliance with ° All learner and driver data encrypted end-to-end.
POPIA ° No personal video/audio is stored without

anonymisation.

Ethical Al Use ° Al cameras tuned for fatigue/distraction detection
with low bias (<0.3%).

° Passenger counting anonymised (numbers only, no

identity).
System Design for e No constant facial recognition of learners; only
Privacy count-based verification.

° Video feeds accessible only to authorised officials
with secure audit logs.

Through these safeguards, we ensure the system is POPIA-compliant, ethical, and
respectful of learner dignity, while delivering trusted operational oversight.
