INTERNAL COMMUNICATION 
  
 
SUBJE CT: MI SUSE OF IN TERNE T AN D DAT A – ZERO TOLERANCE REMINDER  
 
D ear team, 
This is a formal reminder about the company’s expectations regarding the 
responsible use of internet and dig ital resources.  
 
From a recent IT risk assessment done, w e’ve noticed increasing concerns  of: 
• 
Abuse of internet during work hours : Browsing unrelated sites reduces 
produc tivity and distrac ts from our core responsibilities.  
• 
Accessing external websites : Many sites pose security risks, exposing our 
systems to malware, phishing , or data breaches.  
• 
Sharing com pany inform ation on unstable or unauthorized platforms : 
This c reates vulnerabilities that could compromise sensitive data and 
damag e our reputation.  
Specific ally, the re has been ex cessive use of site s like Disney Plus, Netflix, 
AppleTV, Tiktok, RTCP, Snapchat, Facebook , DSTV and Youtube.  
 
These prac tic es are unacc eptable.  They affect bandwidth for business-critical 
activities and platforms.  They reduc e productivity, expose the company to security 
risks, and put sensitive data at risk.  
 
We ask all staff to: 
1. Use the internet primarily for work -related purposes. 
2. Be mindful of the sec urity risks when accessing external platforms.  
3. A void sharing  c ompany data on personal or insecure channels.  
4. Stay foc used on being produc tive and professional during work hours and 
when working  remotely . 
5. D ata provided  by the c ompany for remote work needs to be used for that 
purpose only.  
 
Althoug h we have the option to drill down into individual us age, we are choosing 
not to  for now . We hope that this c ommunication will serve as a warning around 
responsible usage.  Going  forward, n on-compliance will be treated as a serious 
breac h of c ompany policy and may result in disciplinary action.   
 
Thank you for your c ooperation.  
 
Best reg ards, 
Yakshini N aidoo
