INTERNAL COMMUNICATION

SUBJECT: MISUSE OF INTERNET AND DATA - ZERO TOLERANCE REMINDER

Dear team,

This is a formal reminder about the companyâ€™s expectations regarding the
responsible use of internet and digital resources.

From a recent IT risk assessment done, we've noticed increasing concerns of:

e Abuse of internet during work hours: Browsing unrelated sites reduces
productivity and distracts from our core responsibilities.

e Accessing external websites: Many sites pose security risks, exposing our
systems to malware, phishing, or data breaches.

e Sharing company information on unstable or unauthorized platforms:
This creates vulnerabilities that could compromise sensitive data and
damage our reputation.

Specifically, there has been excessive use of sites like Disney Plus, Netflix,
AppleTV, Tiktok, RTCP, Snapchat, Facebook, DSTV and Youtube.

These practices are unacceptable. They affect bandwidth for business-critical

activities and platforms. They reduce productivity, expose the company to security
risks, and put sensitive data at risk.

We ask all staff to:

Use the internet primarily for work-related purposes.

Be mindful of the security risks when accessing external platforms.

Avoid sharing company data on personal or insecure channels.

Stay focused on being productive and professional during work hours and

when working remotely.

5. Data provided by the company for remote work needs to be used for that
purpose only.

Although we have the option to drill down into individual usage, we are choosing
not to for now. We hope that this communication will serve as a warning around
responsible usage. Going forward, non-compliance will be treated as a serious
breach of company policy and may result in disciplinary action.

Thank you for your cooperation.
Best regards,

Yakshini Naidoo
