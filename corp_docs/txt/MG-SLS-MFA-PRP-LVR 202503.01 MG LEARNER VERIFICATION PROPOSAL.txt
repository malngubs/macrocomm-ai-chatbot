AI-Powered Attendance System for Transparent School Funding 
Executive Summary 
South Africa’s school funding system reportedly suffers significant losses each year. This 
misrepresentation diverts critical resources from learners who need them most, leading 
to inefficiencies, financial waste, and a lack of trust in the public education sector. 
Traditional systems often fall short due to the need for human intervention and the lack 
of real-time accuracy. This proposal presents an AI-powered camera-driven solution that 
ensures secure, mobile, and non-invasive biometric authentication using facial 
verification. 
By leveraging AI-powered camera technology and advanced recognition software, the 
system ensures: 
• 
Verifiable learner attendance linked to funding 
• 
Enhanced mobility for real-time attendance capture 
• 
Reduced fraud and improved trust 
• 
Scalable implementation across rural and urban schools 
Some of the reasons South Africa’s school funding program suffers significant losses each 
year is due to several factors, such as: 
Cause of Financial Loss 
Issue 
Description 
Inflated Enrolment Schools report more learners than present to receive excess funds. 
Manual 
Verification 
Existing processes are error-prone and not conducted in real time. 
Changes 
Unreported 
Schools fail to update enrolment records when learners leave the 
school or are transferred. 
Human Error & 
Fraud 
School-led manipulation of records is possible due to lack of 
automation. 
Addressing the Key Pain Points 
This system is purpose-built to solve the most pressing challenges in learner attendance 
reporting, fraud prevention, and resource allocation faced by schools and provincial 
departments, both from an operational perspective, and technical perspective.

The Need for Reliable Connectivity 
For suburban schools, robust terrestrial connectivity like fibre and cable provides the 
necessary bandwidth for online learning platforms and resource access. Rural schools 
however often lack this infrastructure. In these areas, VSAT technology becomes 
essential, offering satellite-based internet that overcomes geographical limitations. This 
dual approach, utilising terrestrial networks in developed areas and VSAT in remote 
regions, ensures equitable access to digital education tools for all students. We also 
recommend that schools in the suburbs consider using VSAT as backup so that real time 
data is not interrupted by load shedding which may affect traditional terrestrial 
connectivity. 
The Need for Better Accountability 
South Africa’s public schooling system relies on a tiered funding model that aligns 
financial support with socio-economic realities. Central to this model is the Quintile 
System, which categorises schools from Quintile 1 (most disadvantaged) to Quintile 5 
(least disadvantaged), determining the level of state funding and expectations around 
school fees. This funding structure, paired with policies such as per-learner allocations 
and financial accountability requirements, aims to bridge inequality and ensure that 
resources are distributed according to need. 
Addressing Accountability in South African School Funding 
A number of the key pain points have been identified, such as reliance on self-reported 
enrolment numbers or the inability to detect discrepancies early, as well as, the potential 
for manipulation of registers or lack of deterrent mechanisms that speak directly to the 
need to strengthen accountability, or generating poor data points which lead to 
misaligned funding, or the lack of data for target action. These are just some of the key 
challenges the department face and therefor eliminating these challenges is a key focal 
point of the solution. 
The below table outlines the core policy elements shaping both funding structures and 
technology considerations within South Africa’s public education framework. 
Funding Structure and Attendance Technology Considerations 
Policy Element 
Description 
 
Quintile System 
• 
Schools are ranked by socio-economic status (Quintiles 1–
5), with lower quintiles receiving higher per-learner grants. 
• 
Quintiles 1–3 are “no-fee” schools, fully state-funded, while 
Quintiles 4–5 supplement grants with school fees.

Per-Learner 
Allocation 
• 
Provincial education departments disburse funds annually 
based on enrolment numbers submitted by schools. 
Accountability 
Framework 
• 
Schools must submit audited financial reports. 
• 
Provincial departments conduct sporadic audits to verify 
enrolment and spending. 
Our AI-powered camera verification system presents a scalable solution to ensure 
accurate learner enrolment and attendance reporting. Instead of relying on traditional 
methods, the system is powered by fixed AI-powered cameras equipped with advanced 
AI facial recognition software, linked to real-time communication tools, enabling instant 
authentication and verification to ensure: 
• 
Accurate Attendance: Schools can receive funding that will be based on real, 
verifiable attendance, preventing alleged fraudulent claims without any human 
intervention. 
• 
Reduced Fraud and Misuse: AI-driven verification eliminates the possibility of false 
reporting through identifying registered learners. 
• 
Enhanced Transparency and Trust: Real-time monitoring fosters accountability 
within the education sector. 
• 
Improved Resource Distribution: Directs funds to schools based on actual needs, 
ensuring learners receive the support they deserve. 
• 
National / Provincial Analysis Reporting: National / Provincial report on how many 
learner anomalies based on lack of attendance. 
• 
Integration and Trend Reports: We will also provide statistics per region based on 
attendance trends for learners, reporting on red flags based on your specified 
business rules.

Our AI-powered camera system integrates facial recognition, real-time data analytics, and 
centralised reporting to accurately verify learner enrolment, eliminate manual reporting, 
prevent fraud, and ensure funds align with actual learner numbers. 
This solution modernises how schools manage attendance while directly addressing 
enrolment fraud, data integrity issues, and inequitable resource allocation. 
The system is built around five key functional areas that enable accurate, secure, and 
real-time attendance tracking while preserving school routines and ensuring ease of 
implementation.

Comparison: Fixed AI Cameras vs. Handheld Devices 
Challenge with Handheld Devices 
Advantage of Fixed AI Cameras 
Reliant on staff to physically operate 
devices, causing delays and 
inconsistency 
Automated, passive verification with no staff 
involvement, faster and more reliable 
Limited coverage – can only scan one 
learner at a time 
Continuous monitoring at entry points or 
classrooms verifies entire groups 
simultaneously 
Devices can be misplaced, damaged, or 
underutilised 
Permanently installed, secure, and tamper-
resistant infrastructure 
Requires frequent charging, transport, 
and handling 
Powered directly with UPS/solar backup for 
uninterrupted operation 
Dependent on operator training and 
correct usage 
Fully automated system requires minimal 
human interaction 
Potential for selective use (e.g., only on 
certain days) undermines consistency 
Always-on cameras ensure attendance is 
tracked every school day without gaps 
Harder to track large schools efficiently 
due to manual scanning 
Scales easily in both small and large schools by 
placing cameras at strategic points 
Data may be delayed if devices are not 
synced immediately 
Real-time data transmission direct to central 
platform 
Higher chance of human bias or error in 
handling verification 
Removes human involvement, ensures 
impartial, standardised verification 
While technology introduces tremendous benefits, its implementation must be sensitive 
to legal, ethical, and practical considerations particularly around learner privacy and 
compliance with South African data protection laws.  
We have taken the required steps to ensure the system and solution being proposed and 
presented, adheres to POPIA requirements and standards, ethical use standards and 
delivered in such a way that we maintain the privacy of all learners.
