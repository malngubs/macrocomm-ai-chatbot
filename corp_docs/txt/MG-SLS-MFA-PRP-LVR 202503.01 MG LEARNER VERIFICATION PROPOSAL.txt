Al-Powered Attendance System for Transparent School Funding
Executive Summary

South Africa’s school funding system reportedly suffers significant losses each year. This
misrepresentation diverts critical resources from learners who need them most, leading
to inefficiencies, financial waste, and a lack of trust in the public education sector.
Traditional systems often fall short due to the need for human intervention and the lack
of real-time accuracy. This proposal presents an Al-powered camera-driven solution that
ensures secure, mobile, and non-invasive biometric authentication using facial
verification.

By leveraging Al-powered camera technology and advanced recognition software, the
system ensures:

e Verifiable learner attendance linked to funding

e Enhanced mobility for real-time attendance capture

e Reduced fraud and improved trust

e Scalable implementation across rural and urban schools
Some of the reasons South Africa's school funding program suffers significant losses each
year is due to several factors, such as:

Cause of Financial Loss

Issue Description

Inflated Enrolment Schools report more learners than present to receive excess funds.

Manual

oo. Existing processes are error-prone and not conducted in real time.
Verification
Changes Schools fail to update enrolment records when learners leave the
Unreported school or are transferred.
Human Error & School-led manipulation of records is possible due to lack of
Fraud automation.

Addressing the Key Pain Points

This system is purpose-built to solve the most pressing challenges in learner attendance
reporting, fraud prevention, and resource allocation faced by schools and provincial
departments, both from an operational perspective, and technical perspective.

The Need for Reliable Connectivity

For suburban schools, robust terrestrial connectivity like fibre and cable provides the
necessary bandwidth for online learning platforms and resource access. Rural schools
however often lack this infrastructure. In these areas, VSAT technology becomes
essential, offering satellite-based internet that overcomes geographical limitations. This
dual approach, utilising terrestrial networks in developed areas and VSAT in remote
regions, ensures equitable access to digital education tools for all students. We also
recommend that schools in the suburbs consider using VSAT as backup so that real time
data is not interrupted by load shedding which may affect traditional terrestrial
connectivity.

The Need for Better Accountability

South Africa’s public schooling system relies on a tiered funding model that aligns
financial support with socio-economic realities. Central to this model is the Quintile
System, which categorises schools from Quintile 1 (most disadvantaged) to Quintile 5
(least disadvantaged), determining the level of state funding and expectations around
school fees. This funding structure, paired with policies such as per-learner allocations
and financial accountability requirements, aims to bridge inequality and ensure that
resources are distributed according to need.

Addressing Accountability in South African School Funding

A number of the key pain points have been identified, such as reliance on self-reported
enrolment numbers or the inability to detect discrepancies early, as well as, the potential
for manipulation of registers or lack of deterrent mechanisms that speak directly to the
need to strengthen accountability, or generating poor data points which lead to
misaligned funding, or the lack of data for target action. These are just some of the key
challenges the department face and therefor eliminating these challenges is a key focal
point of the solution.

The below table outlines the core policy elements shaping both funding structures and
technology considerations within South Africa’s public education framework.

Funding Structure and Attendance Technology Considerations
Policy Element Description

Quintile System ° Schools are ranked by socio-economic status (Quintiles 1-
5), with lower quintiles receiving higher per-learner grants.

e Quintiles 1-3 are “no-fee” schools, fully state-funded, while
Quintiles 4-5 supplement grants with school fees.

Per-Learner ° Provincial education departments disburse funds annually
Allocation based on enrolment numbers submitted by schools.
Accountability ° Schools must submit audited financial reports.
Framework ° Provincial departments conduct sporadic audits to verify

enrolment and spending.

Our Al-powered camera verification system presents a scalable solution to ensure
accurate learner enrolment and attendance reporting. Instead of relying on traditional
methods, the system is powered by fixed Al-powered cameras equipped with advanced
Al facial recognition software, linked to real-time communication tools, enabling instant
authentication and verification to ensure:

e Accurate Attendance: Schools can receive funding that will be based on real,
verifiable attendance, preventing alleged fraudulent claims without any human
intervention.

e Reduced Fraud and Misuse: Al-driven verification eliminates the possibility of false
reporting through identifying registered learners.

e Enhanced Transparency and Trust: Real-time monitoring fosters accountability
within the education sector.

e Improved Resource Distribution: Directs funds to schools based on actual needs,
ensuring learners receive the support they deserve.

e National / Provincial Analysis Reporting: National / Provincial report on how many
learner anomalies based on lack of attendance.

e Integration and Trend Reports: We will also provide statistics per region based on
attendance trends for learners, reporting on red flags based on your specified
business rules.

Proposed Solution: Al-Powered Verification System

Solution Overview

System Response

Automated alerts highlight
sudden drops or irregularities in
attendance.

Enables early intervention.

Principals and SGBs cannot edit
or fabricate biometric logs.

Reduces need for costly manual
audits.

Encrypted, tamper-proof records

Funds are disbursed based on
verifiable presence, not projected
enrolment.

Ensures resource fairness,
especially in lower-quintile
schools.

Analytics highlight trends such as
chronic absenteeism or class-
level disparities.

Enables tailored interventions.

To improve the integrity of learner verification reporting and ensure government funding
is fairly and accurately distributed, we propose a fixed Al-powered camera verification
solution. This replaces unreliable manual methods with automated, real-time attendance

tracking at key school entry and learning points.

Our Al-powered camera system integrates facial recognition, real-time data analytics, and
centralised reporting to accurately verify learner enrolment, eliminate manual reporting,
prevent fraud, and ensure funds align with actual learner numbers.

This solution modernises how schools manage attendance while directly addressing
enrolment fraud, data integrity issues, and inequitable resource allocation.

The system is built around five key functional areas that enable accurate, secure, and
real-time attendance tracking while preserving school routines and ensuring ease of
implementation.

Operational Features of the Al-Powered Camera Attendance System

Function Description System Capabilities

° Offers trend analysis and
red-flag alerts based on
absence patterns.

° Supports equitable funding
through verified data.

These capabilities ensure the system is accurate, secure, scalable, and usable in diverse
school environments from rural no-fee schools to larger urban campuses while
minimising administrative burden.

Implementation & Technological Considerations

As education systems explore the integration of technology to improve efficiency and
accountability, the choice of tools becomes critical, especially in resource-constrained
environments. Al-powered fixed camera attendance systems promise enhanced data
accuracy and learner tracking, but they require upfront planning in infrastructure,
connectivity, and security.

Challenge Details

Installation Costs & Security Risks Cameras require mounting, wiring, and
protection from vandalism.

Connectivity Dependency Continuous power and data connections
are essential, though offline caching and
battery backups can be built in.

Privacy Concerns Always-on cameras raise ethical
considerations about surveillance.

Despite these challenges, fixed Al cameras provide continuous, automated coverage
and minimal reliance on manual staff input, ensuring accuracy and scalability across
schools.

The comparison below highlights the key differences between handheld systems and
fixed Al Cameras, emphasising the operational and long term advantages of Al camera
solutions for a diverse range of school environments.
