INTERNAL COMMUNICATION: 
AIR CONDITIONING 
TEMPERATURE CONTROL 
REMINDER 
 
 
 
Dear Team, 
I trust that you are well 
 
This is a friendly reminder not to adjust the air conditioning controllers in the office. It is 
important to maintain a consistent temperature across all units to ensure comfort and 
optimal efficiency throughout the workspace. All air conditioning controllers must have 
the temperature set to 21°C. 
 
Changing the temperature can affect energy usage and cause discomfort for people 
working in different areas. 
Your health and safety are important to us, by keeping the office at the stable 
temperature of 21°C we avoid creating differing climate conditions in the office which 
may lead to illnesses, for example flu.   
 
Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.
