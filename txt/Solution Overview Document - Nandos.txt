Solution Overview Document
Introduction

This document provides an in-depth overview of various monitoring and metering systems,
including JoJo Tank Sensors, Electricity Meters, Water Meters, Diesel Monitoring, and Gas Meters.
Each of these systems is designed with specific capabilities to offer monitoring, accurate reporting,
and efficient resource management. By leveraging these technologies, businesses can optimise
their utility consumption, enhance operational efficiency, and ensure accurate billing and cost
allocation.

The integration of these systems into a unified platform enables seamless data collection, analysis,
and visualization, empowering users with insights for informed decision-making. This document
explores the features, functionalities, and interdependencies of these monitoring solutions to
provide a comprehensive understanding of their role in resource management.

1. JoJo Tank Sensor

The JoJo Tank Sensor is a water level monitoring system designed to ensure efficient water storage
and consumption management. By utilising ultrasonic sensing technology, it provides timely
insights into tank levels, helping users prevent shortages, optimise water use, and reduce wastage.

Key Features:

e Level Status Monitoring: Uses ultrasonic sensors to track water levels at set intervals.

e Threshold Alerts: Customisable triggers (e.g., low water level at 10%) sent via email or
SMS.

e Consumption Analysis: Tracks historical data to identify patterns and trends in water
usage.

e Integration Capabilities: Compatible with loT platforms for centralised monitoring
and automation.

2. Electricity Meter

Electricity meters play a crucial role in tracking power usage and optimising energy consumption.
These meters provide real-time insights into electricity usage patterns, allowing users to adjust
consumption habits and manage costs effectively.

Key Features:

e Time-of-Use (ToU) Analysis: Enables users to shift energy consumption to off-peak hours,
reducing costs (e.g., RO.50/kWh off-peak vs. R2.50/kWh peak).

e Billing & Cost Allocation: Automates cost distribution across tenants or departments with
detailed PDF reports and generates an Electricity bill.

e Real-Time Monitoring: Tracks electricity usage per circuit or device, identifying
inefficiencies.

e Dashboard & Visualization: Provides Grafana-based visual analytics with anomaly
detection algorithms.

e Load Management: Helps prevent overloading by monitoring consumption limits.
3. Water Meter

Water meters facilitate accurate tracking of water consumption to promote efficient usage and
conservation. These meters can be integrated with sewage monitoring systems for comprehensive
water management.

Key Features:

e Water Consumption Monitoring: Provides timely tracking of water usage.

e Threshold Alerts: Notifies users when consumption exceeds predefined limits.

e Optional Sewage Monitoring: Tracks wastewater levels and ensures compliance with
regulations.

e Tank Level Percentage Monitoring: Works alongside JoJo Tank Sensors to provide
comprehensive water management.

e Automated Reporting & Notifications: Sends detailed reports on water usage trends.

e Billing & Cost Allocation: Supports cost-sharing among tenants or departments and
generates water bills.

4. Diesel Monitoring System

Industries that rely on diesel-powered generators require efficient fuel management to reduce
wastage and ensure optimal performance. The diesel monitoring system provides detailed insights
into fuel levels, usage patterns, and engine run hours.

Key Features:

e Fuel Status & Ignition Monitoring: Tracks real-time fuel levels and engine ignition status.

e Level Status & Engine Hours Tracking: Monitors diesel consumption and machinery
runtime.

e Leak Detection: Identifies anomalies indicating fuel theft or leaks.

e Automated Reporting & Notifications: Generates consumption reports for better
tracking and cost management.

e Remote Monitoring: Accessible via web and mobile applications.

5. Gas Meter

Gas meters enable efficient tracking of LPG consumption, ensuring optimal usage and proper cost
management. These meters play a vital role in energy monitoring for commercial kitchens.

Key Features:

e LPG Gas Consumption Monitoring: Provides timely insights into usage.

e Reporting & Notifications: Sends automated alerts and consumption reports.

e Platform Integration: Works with existing utility management platforms for seamless
tracking.

e Billing & Cost Allocation: Ensures fair distribution of gas usage costs.

e Leakage Alerts: Detects unusual gas consumption that may indicate leaks.
Workflow & Interdependencies

Each metering and monitoring system plays a distinct role, but together, they provide a holistic
view of resource management. Below is how these systems interconnect:

1. Water Meter & JoJo Tank Sensor

e Water Meter: Measures total consumption across a facility.

e Jojo Tank Sensor: Ensures adequate storage and prevents shortages or overflows.

e Synergy: The combination of both ensures efficient water distribution and conservation,
reducing wastage.

2. Electricity Meter & Diesel Monitoring

e Electricity Meter: Tracks grid power usage and helps identify consumption patterns.

e Diesel Monitoring System: Ensures backup generators are fuelled and operating
efficiently.

e Synergy: By analysing electricity and diesel consumption together, businesses can
optimise energy usage by balancing grid power and backup generators, reducing
operational costs.

3. Gas Meter

e Gas Meter: Monitors LPG consumption and provides usage analytics.

e Supplier Bill Management: Ensures accurate cost allocation and financial tracking.

e Synergy: This integration prevents billing discrepancies and helps optimise gas usage
based on demand trends.

4. Reporting & Platform Integration

e All monitoring systems feed into a unified data analytics platform.
e Provides centralised reporting, visualisation, and alerting.
e Enables informed decision-making through trend analysis and anomaly detection.

5. Overlap & Individual Importance

While these systems share reporting and integration capabilities, each is essential due to the
unique nature of utility consumption. Their combined use offers a comprehensive approach to
resource management, maximising efficiency while ensuring sustainability.

Conclusion
By integrating these technologies, businesses can:

e Enhance operational efficiency.

e Reduce utility costs through smart consumption.

e Improve financial management with automated billing.
e Ensure sustainability by minimising resource wastage.
