Macrocomm Fleet Analytics - Systems & Solutions Overview

Introduction

Macrocomm Fleet Analytics is a pioneering leader in the realm of fleet management,
redefining industry standards through the delivery of cutting-edge data analytics. We
specialise in delivering comprehensive fleet management solutions that transcend
traditional commercial offerings. Our innovative approach leverages data analytics,
accurate costing data, and trip information derived from telematics devices to empower
businesses with unparalleled insights into their fleet operations.

Five years in development and benefiting from nearly seven years of machine learning,
launched in February 2018, our fleet analytics system has found favour in the commercial
fleet sector where we now manage fleets, ranging from three vehicles to over six thousand
vehicles in size, for numerous clients from SMMEs through to large corporates.

Core to successes is our ability to integrate data from myriad sources, seamlessly.
Stemming from the birth of our platform/unit agnostic Fleet Analytics product, we have
fine-tuned the art of data cleansing, aggregation, normalisation and presentation, as well
as advanced systems integration.

As dedicated fleet specialists, our agile development team delivers bespoke, dashboard-
style representations of key metrics and actionable insights, enhanced by targeted
customised reporting, designed in conjunction with each client.

Macrocomm Fleet Analytics

Fleet Analytics Overview:

Fleet Analytics revolves around delivering actionable insights to a fleet owner/manager. By
establishing the base of ‘to-the-cent accurate total cost of ownership’ (TCO) and then
identifying potential revenue enhancements, we empower fleet owners with an
optimisation tool that positively impacts on overall efficiencies and resultant running costs.

Distinctive Features:

At Macrocomm, we stand head and shoulders above the competition by harnessing the
power of data analytics to reveal actionable insights aimed at optimising efficiency and
minimising running costs.

Data-Driven Decision Making:

We prioritise informed decision-making by leveraging the wealth of data generated by
telematics devices, along with all costing data attributable to the fleet, processed by our
advanced Al-based analytics engine, to form the foundation for a comprehensive
understanding of fleet performance.

Maintenance PK by Model 12

Driver Behaviour Analytics:

Our expertise extends beyond conventional fleet management, as we specialise in
identifying and rectifying suboptimal driver behaviour. By analysing driver behaviour data,
we assist businesses in cultivating safe, efficient, and cost-effective driving practices,
ultimately leading to substantial reductions in fleet running costs.

Macrocomm takes data analysis to the next level by translating raw data into actionable
insights. Our web-based dashboard offers real-time visualizations and reports, enabling
fleet managers to monitor and optimise operations seamlessly. This dashboard serves as a
central hub for monitoring various metrics, including fuel efficiency, maintenance needs,
and driver performance.

We understand that each business has unique operational requirements. Macrocomm
delivers customised financial and operational reports tailored to the specific needs of our
clients. These reports provide a comprehensive overview of fleet performance, running
costs and wasteful/unnecessary expenditure, enabling businesses to make informed
strategic decisions.

Through automated data harvesting from foreign platforms, we have created an
environment that allows the implementation of the Macrocomm Fleet Analytics system
using existing telematics devices. As such, implementation of the system is without
physically touching vehicles, resulting in speedy and non-disruptive roll-out.

Through accurate costing data and driver behaviour analytics, Macrocomm empowers
businesses to implement measures that significantly reduce fleet running costs, enhancing
overall profitability.

Enhanced Safety:

Our driver behaviour analytics focus not only on cost reduction but also on safety
enhancement. By addressing risky driving behaviours, we contribute to creating a safer
driving environment for both drivers and the public.

Optimised Efficiency and Streamlined Operations:

Our solutions go beyond basic fleet management, optimising operational efficiency
through data-driven insights. This leads to better resource allocation, improved route
planning, and reduced vehicle downtime.

The web-based dashboard centralises fleet data, streamlining the monitoring and
management of operations. This real-time visibility leads to more proactive decision-
making and quicker responses to emerging issues.

Telematics Units:

Our telematics offerings start from basic tracking capabilities (dot-
On-a-map) and top out at sophisticated units capable of monitoring
multiple sensors, including but not limited to, fuel, door open/close,
tyre pressure, cargo hold temperature/humidity/door status and
CANBUS information.

Superior edge computing, across the entire range of units,
facilitates onboard processing of geo-zone, driver ID, GPS speed
and 3-axis accelerometer data, adding to the efficiency in
transmission of the abundance of data pushed to the servers. Further data processing at
server level surrounding customised sensors, alerts and business rules (amongst many
more metrics) feed the user interface.
