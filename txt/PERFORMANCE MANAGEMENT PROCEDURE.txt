The report details the new performance documents to be utilized and proposed
timelines for implementation of the new performance process, in co-ordination
with the business financial year.

1.2 Benefits

Performance Management is how we manage, support and ensure the
performance of teams and individuals against goals through clear and individual
accountabilities. It is a system which can support pay decisions, promotion
decisions and decisions around employee development. Macrocomm’s
performance policy outlines the practices adopted by Macrocomm Group and its
subsidiaries, in order to review and evaluate performance standards in a fair and
equitable manner.

1.3. Areas of Responsibility

It is the responsibility of every direct reporting manager to effectively set the key
performance objectives per reporting staff member and to manage their
performance during the year.

1.4 Performance Management Standards

o The Performance Management process, tools and measurements will be
standardised within the business, enabling improved, accurate and aligned
business information.

o Approved goals are measurable and impact focussed, and are linked to the
strategic objectives of Macrocomm. All KPI’s will be based on the goals of the
CEO.

against agreed outcomes are annually rated by their manager.

e Formal reviews are used to track progress on individuals using a weighting system,
with the following rating scale used for effectiveness:

o 1 = Individual performance consistently does not meet expectations on the
What and the How of delivery against customer, job and goal requirements.

o 2 = On balance, individual performance does not fully meet expectations.
Improvement is required in the What and/or the How related to delivery
against customer and goal requirements.

o 3=On balance, individual performance fully meets expectations. Both the
What and the How is achieved in the delivery against customer and goal
requirements.

o 4=0On balance, individual performance fully meets and occasionally exceeds
customer and goal requirements on the What and the How.

o 5 = On balance, individual performance fully meets expectations and
frequently exceeds customer and goal requirements on both the What and
the How.

o 6 = Individual performance consistently exceeds customer and goal
requirements on both the What and the How.

e These reviews take place twice a year, in September (Mid-year reviews) and
February (Final review).

e The mid-year performance discussion is used to determine how an employee is
tracking against full-year goals and is used as an opportunity to provide coaching
and feedback to improve performance areas prior to year-end.

6.1.2 Alignment of acquisition companies to the Group performance process will
ensure standardisation of process and transferability of performance ratings
across businesses.

significant impacts to salaries and funding if not aligned.

6.2 Legal/Statutory Implications:
6.2.1 Consider implications of managing the performance of acquisition companies

6.3.1 Key people decisions, succession, promotion, development, and increases, will
be based on clear evidence of performance.

6.3.2 Non-performance is managed via an approved poor performance process.
Should an employee not be performing to the required standard, the manager
is requested to embark on a performance evaluation and/or improvement
process. The implications of non-improvement is dismissal.

6.3.3. Non delivery in business-critical roles and funded service lines will result in an
extraction of funds if the business targets are not met continuously within a 3-
month period.

6.4 Financial Implications:

into the remuneration process. The business needs to budget for performance
bonuses, and performance aligned increases.
